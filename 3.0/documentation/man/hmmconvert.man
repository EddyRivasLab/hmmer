.SH NAME
hmmconvert - convert profile file to a HMMER format


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hmmconvert
.I [options]
.I <hmmfile>


.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
The
.B hmmconvert 
utility
converts an input profile file to different HMMER formats.

.PP
By default, the input profile can be in any HMMER format, including
old/obsolete formats from HMMER2, ASCII or binary; the output profile
is a current HMMER3 ASCII format.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available
options.

.TP 
.B -a
Output profiles in ASCII text format. This is the default.

.TP 
.B -b
Output profiles in binary format. 

.TP 
.B -2
Output in legacy HMMER2 ASCII text format, in ls (glocal) mode. This
allows HMMER3 models to be converted back to a close approximation of
HMMER2, for comparative studies.

.TP 
.BI --outfmt " <s>"
Output in a HMMER3 ASCII text format other then the most current one.
Valid choices for 
.I <s>
are "3/b" or "3/a".
The current format is "3/b", and this is the default. There is a
slightly different format "3/a" that was used in some alpha test code.
