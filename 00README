o About this software...

   HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for
   sensitive database searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries.
   

o Getting HMMER

   Source code:    ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/
   WWW home:       http://genome.wustl.edu/eddy/hmmer.html


o Installing HMMER

   In short: type "make" if you're on any UNIX system.
   For more detailed instructions, see INSTALL.
   You should also read the following files:

   COPYING      -- copyright notice, and information on the free software license
   GNULICENSE   -- Full text of the GNU Public License, version 2 (see COPYING)
   NOTES        -- Release notes


o Quick start (...to hell with the documentation...)


o Slow start (ok, where's the documentation?)



o Registering HMMER

   Email eddy@genetics.wustl.edu to register and get on my
   infrequent mailing list of HMMER news, patches, and updates.


o Reporting bugs

   These programs are under active development. Though this
   release has been tested and appears to be stable, bugs may crop up. If
   you use these programs, please help me out and e-mail me with
   suggestions, comments, and bug reports. (eddy@genetics.wustl.edu)
