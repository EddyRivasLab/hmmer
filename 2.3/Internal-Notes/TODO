HMMER 2 development to-do list
RCS $Id$

Known bugs:
   none

Design decisions that are possibly problematic:
 - wing retraction should choose between forward/Viterbi style.
 - Maxmodelmaker() not really max likelihood any more, heuristic decisions.

Missing functionality:
 - beautify alignment display in hmmpfam, hmmsearch
 - verify multiple alignment format i/o in squid: Phylip, ClustalW, PIMA, XFASTA 
 - binary save files unsupported; code is out of date
 - don't have backwards compatibility with old HMM files
 - don't have cross compatibility with SAM/PFSCAN

Programs to write:
 	hmmconfig - reconfiguration of HMM(s)

	hmminfo   - information about HMM(s)

	hmmview   - Java viewer

	hmmtrain  - hmmt phenocopy

Experiments to do:
 - dependence of SW models on length. Should EVD fits include a
   length correction?

Organizational issues:	
 - move EVD code into a file evd.c
 - rename Plan7 functions; get rid of all the P7's and Plan7's.
 - automated testing - improve Shiva set

Papers?
 	o MAP model construction

	o ML fitting of EVD

	o Plan7 architecture w.r.t. algorithm generalizations
