 *
 * Purpose:  Implementation of the "two-step" fragment sampling
 *           algorithm, sampling a uniform local fragment w.r.t.
 *           sequence coords, by first sampling a complete
 *           sequence of length L from <hmm>; then choosing
 *           a random fragment <i1..i2> uniformly from all
 *           possible $\frac{L(L+1)/2}$ fragments;  then finding
 *           local alignment coordinates wrt model and sequence,
 *           using convention that local alignment starts/stops
 *           with match states. (Thus, if the initially selected
 *           i1 or i2 were generated by insert states, bounds
 *           are moved to reach first/last match state.)
 *           
 *           The caller also provides an allocated sequence <sq> and
 *           traceback <tr>, as storage to be provided to
 *           <p7_CoreEmit()>. They contain the generated global
 *           sequence and trace upon return (not a local trace, note).
 *           
 *           i endpoints are normalized/discretized to 1..<Lbins>, so
 *           we can collate i statistics from sampled sequences of
 *           varying L. Note this causes discretization artifacts,
 *           leading to underrepresentation of j=M and
 *           overrepresentation of i=1.
 *           
 *           This routine is only intended for collecting endpoint
 *           statistics (i1,i2,k1,k2); it does not generate a local
 *           alignment trace. (xref milestone 2, STL11/115).
 *           
 * Returns:  <eslOK> on success; returns normalized/binned sequence
 *           coords in <*ret_i1> and <*ret_i2> in range <1..Lbins> and
 *           the model entry/exit coords in <*ret_k1> and <*ret_k2> in
 *           range <1..M>. By internal def'n of local alignment endpoints,
 *           M_k1 emits residue x_i1, M_k2 emits residue x_i2.

 * Incept:    SRE, Fri Jan 26 13:16:09 2007 [Janelia]
 *
 * Purpose:   Wrapper around <p7_ProfileEmit()>, sampling a local
 *            alignment fragment from the profile's probabilistic model
 *            (which may be the implicit model of HMMER3, or the
 *            Plan7 model of HMMER2), and reporting coordinates
 *            of the fragment w.r.t. both model and sequence.
 *            
 *            To simplify the implementation, the profile must be in
 *            <p7_UNILOCAL> mode, not <p7_LOCAL> mode, so we know we
 *            only have to deal with a single hit per sampled
 *            sequence. 
 *            
 *            We want <i1..i2> to be relative to the sequence coords
 *            of a complete (global) sampled sequence that we could
 *            have sampled this local alignment from; but the <i1..i2>
 *            we initially get are relative to our profile-sampled
 *            trace, so they are offset both by N-generated residues
 *            that occur in the profile and by residues that the
 *            profile's local entry skipped. To translate from
 *            profile/sequence coords to core model/sequence coords,
 *            we use rejection sampling: sample traces from the core
 *            model until we find one that uses the same statetypes
 *            at *initial* entry/exit points <k1>,<k2>, then use
 *            that sample's sequence to determine offsets and correct
 *            <i1..i2> reference frame.
 *            
 *            Local alignment endpoints are defined to be
 *            match-delimited. However, an H3 model allows exit on
 *            either a D or M state. Thus, the initially sampled end
 *            point k2 may need to be rolled back to last M state, to
 *            satisfy local alignment endpoint definition. Entries are
 *            not a problem; both H2 and H3 profiles can only enter on
 *            a M state. (This rollback has to occur after we've
 *            matched a core trace to the profile trace to determine
 *            i offsets.)
 *            
 *            Then, sampling from both the core model and the profile
 *            in the same routine introduces a complication:
 *            conceivably, profile configuration alters the transition
 *            probabilities in the core model (by adding <M->E>
 *            transitions and renormalizing the M transition
 *            distributions, for example; H2 configuration does this,
 *            though H3 does not). So you can't <CoreSample()> the
 *            <gm->hmm> safely. To avoid such things, the caller
 *            provides a clean copy of the core model in <core>.
 *            
 *           i endpoints are normalized/discretized to 1..<Lbins>, so
 *           we can collate i statistics from sampled sequences of
 *           varying L. Note this causes discretization artifacts,
 *           leading to underrepresentation of j=M and
 *           overrepresentation of i=1.
 *           
 * Returns:  <eslOK> on success; returns normalized sequence coords in
 *           <*ret_i1> and <*ret_i2>, and the model entry/exit coords
 *           in <*ret_k1> and <*ret_k2>.

 *     local  |   sw (p7_UNILOCAL)          fs (p7_LOCAL)
 *    glocal  |    s (p7_UNIGLOCAL)         ls (p7_GLOCAL)
 *
 * Additionally, each search mode is configured for a particular
 * target length. Thus "LS/400" means a model configured for glocal,
 * multihit alignment of a target sequence of length 400.
 *
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Exegesis. 
 * 
 * When you enter this module, you've got an HMM (P7_HMM) in "core"
 * probability form: t[], mat[], ins[] are all valid, normalized
 * probabilities. The routines here are used to create the "profile"
 * form (P7_PROFILE) of the model: tsc[], msc[], isc[], bsc[], esc[],
 * and xsc[] fields as integer log-odds scores.
 * 
 * Also in the process, xt[] are set to their algorithm-dependent
 * probabilities, though these probabilities are only for reference.
 * 
 * The configuration process breaks down into distinct conceptual steps:
 * 
 * 1. Algorithm configuration.
 *    An "algorithm mode" is chosen. This determines whether
 *    alignments will allow local entry/exit in the model, and sets
 *    the probabilities in xt[XTE], which determine
 *    multi-hit/single-hit behavior.  The "nj" value of the HMM is
 *    also set here (the expected # of times the J state will be used;
 *    0 for single-hit mode and 1 for the default parameterization of
 *    multihit modes).
 *    
 * 2. Wing retraction.
 *    In a profile, the D_1 and D_M states of the core model are
 *    removed. The probability of the paths B->D1...->Mk ("BMk") that
 *    enter D1 and use all D's before reaching M_k is treated instead
 *    as an additional dollop of B->Mk entry probability, and the
 *    probability of paths Mk->Dk+1...D_M->E ("MkE") is treated
 *    instead as an additional dollop of Mk->E exit probability.  The
 *    MkE path probability is subtracted from the Mk->Dk+1 transition.
 *    
 *    In local algorithm modes, these extra dollops are ignored, and
 *    the model is renormalized appropriately. That is, the algorithm
 *    overrides all B->DDDD->M and/or M->DDDD->E path probabilities
 *    with its own internal entry/exit probabilities.
 *    
 *    If the algorithm mode is "global" at either entry or exit, then
 *    the internal entries are set to BMk and internal exits are set
 *    to MkE, and the model is renormalized appropriately.  That is,
 *    the algorithm treats B->DDDD->M and/or M->DDDD->E path
 *    probabilities as internal entries/exits, instead of allowing
 *    dynamic programming algorithms to use the D_1 or D_M states.
 *    
 *    These two alternatives are represented differently in traces,
 *    where an X state is used to signal 'missing data' in a local
 *    alignment. Thus B->X->Mk indicates local entry, whereas B->Mk in
 *    a trace indicates a wing-retracted B->DDD->Mk entry with respect
 *    to the core HMM; similarly Mk->X->E indicates local exit, and
 *    Mk->E indicates a Mk->DDDD->E path in the core HMM.
 *    
 *    Wing retraction is a compulsive detail with two purposes. First,
 *    it removes a mute cycle from the model, B->D1 ...D_M->E, which
 *    cannot be correctly and efficiently dealt with by DP
 *    recursions. (A DP algorithm could just *ignore* that path
 *    though, and ignore the negligible amount of probability in it.)
 *    Second, wing retraction reconciles the algorithm-dependent
 *    entry/exit probabilities with the core model. For algorithms
 *    that impose local internal entry/exit, we don't want there to be
 *    any additional probability coming from "internal" B->DDD->M and
 *    M->DDD->E paths, so wing retraction takes it away.
 *  
 *  3. Local alignment D-path leveling.
 *    For fully local alignments, we want every fragment ij (starting
 *    at match i, ending from match j) to be equiprobable. There are
 *    M(M+1)/2 possible such fragments, so the probability of each
 *    one is 2/M(M+1). 
 *    
 *    Notionally, we imagine a "model" consisting of the M(M+1)/2
 *    possible fragments, with entry probability of 2/M(M+1) for each.
 *    
 *    Operationally, we achieve this by a trick inspired by a
 *    suggestion from Bill Bruno. Bill suggested that for a model with
 *    no delete states, if we set begin[k] = 1/(M-k+1) and end[k] =
 *    (M-k+1) / [M(M+1)/2], all fragments are equiprobable: the prob
 *    of any given fragment is
 *         b_i * e_j * \prod_{k=i}^{j-1} (1-e_k);
 *    that is, the fragment also includes (j-i) penalizing terms for
 *    *not* ending at i..j-1. Remarkably, this gives the result we
 *    want: this product is always 2/M(M+1), for any ij.
 *    
 *    However, D->D transitions throw a wrench into this trick,
 *    though. A local alignment that goes M_i->D...D->M_j, for
 *    example, only gets hit with one not-end penalty (for the
 *    M_i->D). This means that paths including deletions will be
 *    artifactually favored.
 *    
 *    A solution is to subtract log(1-e_k) from the deletion
 *    transition scores as well as the match transition scores.  Thus
 *    one log(1-e_k) penalty is always exacted upon transitioning from
 *    any node k->k+1. This is *not* part of the probabilistic model:
 *    it is a score accounting trick that forces the DP algorithms to
 *    associate a log(1-e_k) penalty for each node k->k+1 transition,
 *    which makes the DP calculations give the result desired for our
 *    *notional* probabilistic model with a single 2/M(M+1) transition
 *    for each possible fragment. (A similar accounting trick is the
 *    use of log-odds scoring, where we associate null model
 *    transitions and emissions with appropriate terms in the HMM, to
 *    assure that the final score of any path accounts for all the
 *    desired probability terms in an overall log-odds score). The
 *    overall score of any fragment can be rearranged such that there
 *    is one term consisting of a product of all these penalties * b_i
 *    * e_j = 2/M(M+1), and another term consisting of the actual
 *    model transition path score between i,j.
 *    
 * 4. Target length dependence. 
 *    Given a particular target sequence of length L, we want our HMM score
 *    to be as independent as possible of L. Otherwise, long sequences will
 *    give higher scores, even if they are nonhomologous. 
 *    
 *    The traditional solution to this is Karlin/Altschul statistics,
 *    which tells us that E(s=x) = KMNe^-{\lambda x}, so we expect to
 *    have to make a -1 bit score correction for every 2x increase in
 *    target sequence length (ignoring edge correction effects). K/A
 *    statistics have been proven for local Viterbi single-hit
 *    ungapped alignments. There is abundant literature showing they
 *    hold empirically for local Viterbi single-hit gapped
 *    alignments. In my hands the length dependence (though not the
 *    form of the distribution) holds for any single-hit alignment
 *    (local or glocal, Viterbi or forward) but it does not
 *    hold for multihit alignment modes.
 *    
 *    HMMER's solution is to build the length dependence right into
 *    the probabilistic model, so that we have a full probabilistic
 *    model of the target sequence. We match the expected lengths of
 *    the model M and the null model R by setting the p1, N, C, and J
 *    transitions appropriately. R has to emit the whole sequence, so
 *    it has a self-transition of L/(L+1). N, C, and J have to emit
 *    (L-(k+1)x) residues of the sequence, where x is the expected
 *    length of an alignment to the core model, and k is the expected
 *    number of times that we cycle through the J state. k=0 in sw
 *    mode, and k=1 in fs/ls mode w/ the standard [XTE][LOOP]
 *    probability of 0.5.
 *
 * 5. Conversion of probabilities to integer log-odds scores.
 *    This step incorporates the contribution of the null model,
 *    and converts floating-point probs to the scaled integer log-odds
 *    score values that are used by the DP alignment routines. 
 *
 * Step 1 is done by the main p7_ProfileConfig() function, which takes
 * a choice of algorithm mode as an argument.
 *
 * Step 2 is done by the *wing_retraction*() functions, which also
 *  go ahead and convert the affected transitions to log-odds scores;
 *  left wing retraction sets bsc[], right wing retraction sets
 *  esc[] and tsc[TM*].
 *  
 * Step 3 is carried out by one of two delete path accounting routines,
 *  which go ahead and set tsc[TD*].
 *  
 * Step 4 is carried out by the p7_ReconfigLength() routine.
 * 
 * Step 5 is carried out for all remaining scores by logoddsify_the_rest().   
 * 
 * Note that the profile never exists in a configured probability
 * form. The probability model for the search profile is implicit, not
 * explicit, because of the handling of local entry/exit transitions.
 * You can see this in more detail in emit.c:p7_ProfileEmit()
 * function, which samples sequences from the profile's probabilistic
 * model.
 *
 * So, overall, to find where the various scores and probs are set:
 *   bsc      :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   esc      :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   tsc[TM*] :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   tsc[TI*] :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 4)
 *   tsc[TD*] :  dpath leveling           (section 3)
 *   p1       :  target_ldependence()     (section 4)  
 *   xt[NCJ]  :  target_ldependence()     (section 4)  
 *   xsc (all):  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 4)
 *   msc      :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 5)
 *   isc      :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 5)

 * 2. The four config_*() functions for specific algorithm modes.
 *****************************************************************/

/*****************************************************************
 * Exegesis.
 *
 * The following functions are the Plan7 equivalent of choosing
 * different alignment styles (fully local, fully global,
 * global/local, multihit, etc.)
 * 
 * When you come into a configuration routine, the following
 * probabilities are valid in the model:
 *    1. t[1..M-1][0..6]: all the state transitions.
 *       (Node M is special: it has only a match and a delete state,
 *       no insert state, and M_M->E = 1.0 and D_M->E = 1.0 by def'n.)
 *    2. mat[1..M][]:  all the match emissions.
 *    3. ins[1..M-1][]: all the insert emissions. Note that there is
 *       no insert state in node M.
 *    4. tbd1: the B->D1 probability. The B->M1 probability is 1-tbd1.
 * These are the "data-dependent" probabilities in the model.
 * 
 * The configuration routine gets to set the "algorithm-dependent"
 * probabilities:
 *    1. xt[XTN][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls unaligned N-terminal seq.
 *       The higher xt[XTN][LOOP] is, the more unaligned seq we allow.
 *       Similarly, xt[XTC][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls unaligned C-terminal 
 *       seq, and xt[XTJ][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls length of unaligned sequence
 *       between multiple copies of a domain. Normally, if these are nonzero,
 *       they are all set to be equal to hmm->p1, the loop probability
 *       for the null hypothesis (see below).
 *    2. xt[XTE][MOVE,LOOP] distribution controls multihits. 
 *       Setting xt[XTE][LOOP] to 0.0 forces one hit per model.
 *    3. begin[1..M] controls entry probabilities. An algorithm 
 *       mode either imposes internal begin probabilities, or leaves begin[1] 
 *       as 1.0 and begin[k] = 0.0 for k>1.
 *    4. end[1..M] controls exit probabilities. An algorithm mode either
 *       imposes internal exit probabilities, or leaves end[M] = 1.0
 *       and end[k] = 0.0 for k<M.
 *    
 * The configuration routine then calls routines as appropriate to set
 * up all the model's scores, given these configured probabilities. When
 * the config routine returns, all scores are ready for alignment:
 * bsc, esc, tsc, msc, isc, and xsc.
 * 
 *****************************************************************
 *
 * SRE: REVISIT THE ISSUE BELOW. THE CONDITIONS ARE NO LONGER MET!
 *
 * There is (at least) one more issue worth noting.
 * If you want per-domain scores to sum up to per-sequence scores, which is
 * generally desirable if you don't want "bug" reports from vigilant users,
 * then one of the following two sets of conditions must be met:
 *   
 *   1) t(E->J) = 0    
 *      e.g. no multidomain hits
 *      
 *   2) t(N->N) = t(C->C) = t(J->J) = hmm->p1 
 *      e.g. unmatching sequence scores zero, and 
 *      N->B first-model score is equal to J->B another-model score.
 *      
 * These constraints are obeyed in the default Config() functions below,
 * but in the future (say, when HMM editing may be allowed) we'll have
 * to remember this. Non-equality of the summed domain scores and
 * the total sequence score is a really easy "red flag" for people to
 * notice and report as a bug, even if it may make probabilistic
 * sense not to meet either constraint for certain modeling problems.
