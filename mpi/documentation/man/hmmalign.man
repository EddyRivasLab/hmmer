.SH NAME
.TP 
hmmalign - align sequences to a profile HMM

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hmmalign
.I [options]
.I hmmfile
.I seqfile

.SH DESCRIPTION

Perform a multiple sequence alignment of all the sequences in
.I seqfile,
by aligning them individually to the profile HMM in
.I hmmfile.

The new alignment is output to 
.I stdout
in Stockholm format.


The sequences in 
.I seqfile
are aligned in unihit local alignment mode.  Therefore they should
already be known to contain a single domain; they should not contain
more than one domain.  They may be fragments.  The optimal alignment
may assign some residues as nonhomologous (N and C states), in which
case these residues are still included in the resulting alignment, but
shoved to the outer edges. To trim these nonhomologous residues from
the result, see the
.B --trim
option.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available
options.

.TP
.BI -o " <f>"
Direct the output alignment to file
.I <f>,
rather than to
.I stdout.

.TP
.BI --mapali " <f>"
Merge the existing alignment in file 
.I <f>
into the result, where 
.I <f> 
is exactly the same alignment that was used to build the model in  
.I hmmfile.
This is done using a "map" of alignment columns to consensus 
profile positions that is stored in the
.I hmmfile.

.TP
.B --trim
Trim nonhomologous residues (assigned to N and C states in the optimal
alignments) from the resulting multiple alignment output. 

.TP
.B --amino
Specify that all sequences in 
.I seqfile
are proteins. By default, alphabet type is autodetected
from looking at the residue composition.

.TP
.B --dna
Specify that all sequences in 
.I seqfile
are DNAs.

.TP
.B --rna
Specify that all sequences in 
.I seqfile
are RNAs.

.TP 
.BI --informat " <s>"
Declare that the input
.I seqfile
is in format 
.I <s>.
Accepted sequence file formats include FASTA, EMBL, Genbank, DDBJ,
Uniprot, Stockholm, and SELEX. Default is to autodetect the format of
the file.

.TP 
.BI --outformat " <s>"
Specify that the 
.I msafile
is in format 
.I <s>.
Currently the accepted multiple alignment sequence file formats only
include Stockholm and SELEX. Default is to autodetect the format of
the file.
