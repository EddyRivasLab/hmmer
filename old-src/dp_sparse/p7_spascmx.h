 * Rationale for UP sector unreachable special cases:
 *  u1-1 (prev to 1st row) not in UP sector, but has special needs; see [1].
 *  In top row u1, IL/IG unreached in Fwd, because no M/I on row u1-1.
 *  In bot row u2, for all k<k0-1, IL/IG unreached in Bck, because no row u2+1;
 *     IL/IG(k0-1) do have path to anchor cell. 
 *  In 1st col k=1, DL1 unreachable in Fwd, because no M/D at k=0; 
 *     DG1 unreachable in F/B because of wing retraction;
 *     DG1 valid in decoding because of G->DG1..DGk-1->MGk wing unfold
 *  In last col k0-1, for all i<u2, DL/DG unreachable in Bck, because no k+1;
 *     DL/DG at u2,k0-1 do have path to anchor cell.
 *  If 0 rows in UP: u1-1 special case only: and k0-1 case is 0 0 g! (hence ? mark)
 *  If 1 row in UP:  u1-1, u1 : and k0-1 case is 0 0 g!
 *  If 2 rows in UP: u1-1 u1, u2
 *
 * Rationale for DOWN sector unreachable special cases:
 *  In anchor cell i0,k0 (top left corner of DOWN sector) only MG/ML are used.
 *  For rest of top row i0, ML/MG, IL/IG unreachable in Fwd, because no i-1 row
 *  For rest of left col k0, ML/MG, DL/DG unreachable in Fwd, because no k-1 col (and no LG->Mk entry in DOWN)
 *  In bot row d2, IL/IG unreachable in Bck, because no i+1 row
 *  In 2nd col k0+1, DL/DG unreachable in Fwd, because M/D unreachable in k-1 col 
 *  In 2nd row i0+1, k>k0, IL/IG unreachable in Fwd, because M/I unreachable on i0 row except anchor i0,k0
 *  In last col k=M, IL/IGm state never exists.
 *  If 1 row in DOWN:  i0 
 *  If 2 rows in DOWN: i0, d2
 *  If 3 rows in DOWN: i0, i0+1, d2

 *****************************************************************
 *
 * [2] ON STORAGE OF UP SECTOR BOUNDARY ROWS i1-1
 *    
 * The "i1-1" row is the row previous to the first row of the UP
 * sector. This may either be a row ia(g)-1 preceding a sparse segment
 * (where no sparse supercell storage exists; including row 0 case),
 * or an anchor row i0 (where sparse cells may exist because of an
 * arguable design decision). (The first case is the first UP sector
 * in a segment, where we're U only; the second case is all other UP
 * sectors in the segment, where we're D-U.)  No emitting state (M/I)
 * can be reached on this row, and neither can the DL states, but the
 * DG states need consideration, as follows.
 *    
 * The {LG} states that can transition to ML/MG(i1) are on i1-1
 * row. DG states on row i1-1 can be reached by G->DG1..DGk-1->MGk
 * wing unfolding. We only unfold in decoding, so these DG states are
 * unreachable in F/B. We don't store any main supercells for row 0
 * nor for rows ia(g)-1, so we do no unfolding of DG probability
 * there. BUT: because we decided to keep sparse UP supercells on
 * anchor rows i0(d-1), that means we may have supercells on these
 * i1-1 prev rows. Thus for completeness, we decode MGs by wing
 * unfolding in any such cells.
 *     
 * This design decision could be made a different way. Since we never
 * care about DG decoding on rows 0 or ia(g)-1, why care about DG
 * decoding when the UP boundary is i0(d-1)? We could simply not allow
 * any sparse supercells other than the i0,k0 DOWN anchor cell on
 * anchor rows i0. We'd save some supercell storage that way (though
 * probably not much, because anchor cell i0,k0 is usually highly
 * probable by construction, so other supercells on same row are
 * unlikely to appear in sparse mask). No good reason for not doing it
 * this way... I didn't realize it was an issue until late, and I
 * already have it coded with these supercells included, and I'm
 * loathe to code it differently (and possibly discover unexpected
 * kinks).
