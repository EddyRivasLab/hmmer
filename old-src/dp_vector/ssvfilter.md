## ssvfilter: vectorized SSV (Single Segment Viterbi) filter

```
  SSVFilter -> VitFilter -> ForwardFilter -> BackwardFilter
  ^^^^^^^^^
(you are here)
```

The SSV filter is the first and fastest step in the acceleration
pipeline.

The SSV filter was originally written for x86 SSE instructions by
Bjarne Knudsen, based on the HMMER3 MSV filter published in 2010. In
HMMER 3.1, we incorporated SSV as a prefilter before MSV. Travis
Wheeler showed, when he was developing `nhmmer` (which does not use
MSV), that MSV is essentially unnecessary once SSV is used. In HMMER4,
we plan to remove the MSV filter, and use only SSV.

### Knudsen implementation notes

The following notes are from Bjarne Knudsen, in his contributed code.

#### REMOVING THE J STATE

The original MSV filter allows use of the J state to chain together
multiple matches in different diagonals. Thus, a full match can
consist of diagonal match followed by the J state and then another
diagonal match later in the sequence.  Going through the J state
has a certain price so for the full match to contain two different
diagonal matches connected by the J state, each of the individual
diagonal matches must score higher than the cost of going through
the J state.

It turns out that even the best match in a model-sequence
comparison rarely scores higher than the cost of going through the
J state. This is the basis of the idea used here, which is to
completely ignore the J state. To avoid this leading to false
negatives, we check the resulting maximum score against the cost of
the going through the J state. In the rare cases where the J state
may in fact have been used, we return `eslNORESULT`. This indicates
to the original J state that it should recalculate the score.

Since removing the J state allows significant improvements in
speed, the extra overhead of having to go through the original MSV
filter in about 1% of the cases is not a problem.

Note that for the score to actually be different, we need two
diagonals to have a high scoring match, but we cannot easily check
for that. Thus, oftentimes the re-calculated score in the original
MSV filter will be the same as without the J state.

The code governing the use of the J state in the original filter is:

```
  xEv = _mm_subs_epu8(xEv, tecv);
  xJv = _mm_max_epu8(xJv,xEv);
  xBv = _mm_max_epu8(basev, xJv);
```

So for an xE value to be high enough to affect xJ, the following
inequality must be true:

```
  xJ = xE - om->tec_b > om->base_b
```

We defer this check until the final maximal xE value has been
calculated. If the above holds true, we return `eslNORESULT`.

Since the J state is removed, the xBv vector is constant, so we can
set it once an for all to a vector where all entries are:

```
  om->base_b - om->tjb_b - om->tbm_b
```

But see the following section for why this is changed for other
reasons.


#### INTERNAL LOOP ADJUSTMENT AND IMPLICATIONS

The following assumes that we have already gotten rid of the J
state.

Here is an analysis of what is going on in the central loop. The
original code is:

```
  sv  = _mm_max_epu8(sv, xBv);          // [1]
  sv  = _mm_adds_epu8(sv, biasv);       // [2]
  sv  = _mm_subs_epu8(sv, *rsc); rsc++; // [3]
  xEv = _mm_max_epu8(xEv, sv);          // [4]
```

Here is a line by line description:

  1: If sv is below xBv, it is set to xBv. xBv is the begin score,
     which is `om->base_b - om->tjb_b - om->tbm_b`.

  2: The bias (`om->bias_b`) is added. This is done since we are
     using unsigned numbers and the score can be both positive and
     negative. The bias is the negative of the highest value the
     real match scores may have.

  3: The match score (and bias) is subtracted. The subtracted score
     must be positive since we using are unsigned bytes, thus the
     score subtracted here is the one adjusted for bias. We also
     progress to the next match score (rsc++).

  4: The global maximum is updated.

When the everything has been traversed, xEv is checked for a number
of conditions. First, the maximum value is extracted to xE, though.

if xE is greater than or equal to 255 - om->bias_b, there may have
been an overflow, and the result is reported as infinite.

Since we ignored the J state, we have to check whether it could
potentially have been used, possibly resulting in a higher
score. This is the case if (xE - om->tec_b) > om->base_b. The left
side of the check is the highest score that xJ could have
attained. In the original MSV filter this score would only have
affected the begin scores if this xJ value exceeded
om->base_b. This explains the check.

Now, we optimize this internal loop by using two ideas:

  A: Get rid of line 1 by using saturation. This can be done
     because xBv is a constant vector after getting rid of the J
     state.

  B: Combine lines 2 and 3 by using a single signed subtraction
     instead of an unsigned addition followed by an unsigned
     subtraction.

It is a challenge that SSE2 does not have a signed byte max
operation, yet we need to subtract a signed byte in idea B. First
the new code, then the explanation:

```
  sv   = _mm_subs_epi8(sv, *rsc); rsc++;
  xEv  = _mm_max_epu8(xEv, sv);
```

The last line is unchanged, i.e. the overall max is still done as
an unsigned maximum. The subtraction is saturated to satisfy idea A
and it is signed to satisfy idea B.

To make the saturation work in the lower end of the scale, the
begin scores have to equal signed -128 which is the same as
unsigned 128, or a bit value of 10000000.  Thus, we basically shift
the calculation with a (signed) value of `-(om->base_b - om->tjb_b -
om->tbm_b + 128)`, which takes the original begin value to -128.

Since we are using an unsigned maximum, the signed saturation at
+127 will not work. Thus, if the score gets high enough, we are
going to pass from signed negative values to non-negative values
without any saturation kicking in. In the unsigned domain this
basically constitutes an overflow from 255 to 0. This means that we
may miss a high score of it crosses this boundary.

The highest positive effect that the subtraction can have is to add
om->bias_b, since this is the highest real match score. So only
scores strictly higher than 255 - om->bias_b in the unsigned domain
may cause an overflow. In the signed domain this corresponds to `-1 - om->bias_b`.

When the calculation is all done, we may check xE against this
boundary to determine if an overflow might have occurred. The other
thing to consider is the check for whether the J state may have
been used. This happens when:

```
  (xE + (om->base_b - om->tjb_b - om->tbm_b - 128) - om->tec_b) 
         > om->base_b. 
  <=>   xE > om->tjb_b + om->tbm_b + om->tec_b + 128
```

Thus, we have these two checks:

```
  xE >= 255 - om->bias_b                        (possible overflow)

  xE > om->tjb_b + om->tbm_b + om->tec_b - 128  (possible J state)
```

To avoid having to call too many false positives, we do not want
the overflow to occur before the J state becomes possible. This
mean that we want:

```
  (Overflow => J state)

  <=>  255 - om->bias_b > om->tjb_b + om->tbm_b + om->tec_b + 128

  <=>  om->tjb_b + om->tbm_b + om->tec_b + om->bias_b < 127
```

The worst case bias is 19, om->tec_B is 3 for a sequence length of
L and a model length of M, we have:

```
  om->tjb_b = 3logf(3 / (L + 3))
  om->tbm_b = 3logf(2 / (M(M + 1)))
```

So if the sequence length is L = 1,000,000, the longest possible
model where the above holds true is M = 482. If the model size is M
= 2,295 (the largest in Pfam 23.0), the longest sequence length
where the condition is true is L = 43,786. So, the condition is not
always true, but typically, it is. And, importantly, it can be
checked.

A final thing to consider is what to do on an overflow. Since we
shifted the baseline for the calculation, the question is if an
overflow is necessarily going to happen in the original MSV
filter. This is true when our baseline as no higher than the
original MSV filter baseline.  Thus, when the following holds we
know that an overflow will occur for the original filter:

```
  om->base_b - om->tjb_b - om->tbm_b >= 128
```

If it does not hold, we are not sure what the true result is and we
have to indicate that in the return value.

Since we perform a single signed subtraction instead of an unsigned
addition followed by in unsigned subtraction, a new set of match
scores have been introduced in the P7_OPROFILE structure. These are
called sb where the originals are rb.

#### EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The basic idea is to traverse the sequence while analyzing only
enough diagonals that they may residue in registers rather than
memory. This may require several traversals of the sequence, but
this is still worth it due to reduced memory access.

So we have a basic calculation concept where we fill out some
number of adjacent striped diagonal vectors throughout the whole
sequence. Consider a simple case where we have two registers, A and
B and they each have only two fields instead of 16. In one sweep of
a sequence we calculate the following matrix cells:

```
    |  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA
    | BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA 
    |BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  
  H |A  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  B
  M |  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA
  M | BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA 
    |BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  
    |A  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  B
     ----------------------------
               Sequence
```

When the top entry in one of the vectors hits the top, the vector
must be left shifted to be ready for the next column. This first
happens to the last vector (B), then in the following round to the
first vector (A).

This means that the sweep contains two different phases: one where
vectors are being moved without shifting and then a phase where the
vectors are being shifted one by one until the have all been
shifted. If we have Q sets of 16 diagonal and we have w registers
in use, the first phase takes Q - w rounds and the second phase
takes w rounds and we are back where we started. This is done until
the sequence ends.

After having done this, we do another sweep, where we calculate the
remaining cells:

```
    |BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  
    |A  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  B
    |  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA
  H | BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA 
  M |BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  
  M |A  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  B
    |  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA
    | BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA  BA 
     ----------------------------
               Sequence
```

This sweep is identical to the first, except there is an offset to
the starting point. We call this offset q which is 2 in this case
and 0 above).

Apart from the model, sequence, etc., the core calculation has two
parameters: w and q. If we have three registers and Q = 8, we do
three sweeps:

```
  sweep 1: q = 0, w = 3
  sweep 2: q = 3, w = 3
  sweep 3: q = 6, w = 2
```

This covers all diagonals and we are done.

To make the compiler use registers as much as possible, we have to
be quite specific about what is going on, so we have to make a
function for each value of w. Since 64 bit machines have 16 xmm
registers, we need quite a few of these functions. It is also
possible that some of the diagonals actually end up in memory while
retaining high performance since a few scattered memory accesses
are not going to slow things down.

To make the code maintainable, we cannot write out all these
functions. Instead the are defined via macros. So a function
definition may look like this:

```
  __m128i calc_band_6(ESL_DSQ *dsq, int L, P7_OPROFILE *om, int q, __m128i beginv, __m128i xEv)
  {
    CALC(RESET_6, STEP_BANDS_6, CONVERT_6, 6)
  }
```

The parameters are the sequence, its length, the model, the q
value, a begin vector and the max vector. The return value is the
updated max vector. The whole body of the function is defined as a
macro with parameters that are themselves expanded macros (apart
from the last parameter).

The RESET macro defines and resets the xmm variables in the
function. It is defined recursively:

```
  #define RESET_1()
    register __m128i sv00 = beginv;

  #define RESET_2()
    RESET_1()
    register __m128i sv01 = beginv;

  #define RESET_3()
    RESET_2()
    register __m128i sv02 = beginv;
```

So the variables holding the scores for the diagonals are called
sv00, sv01, etc.

The next macro is STEP_BANDS, which moves the diagonals. Again,
this is a recursively defined macro:

```
  #define STEP_BANDS_1()
    STEP_SINGLE(sv00)

  #define STEP_BANDS_2()
    STEP_BANDS_1()
    STEP_SINGLE(sv01)

  #define STEP_BANDS_3()
    STEP_BANDS_2()
    STEP_SINGLE(sv02)
```

So we end up using STEP_SINGLE on each vector. This is where the
central calculation is done as described above:

```
  #define STEP_SINGLE(sv)
    sv   = _mm_subs_epi8(sv, *rsc); rsc++;
    xEv  = _mm_max_epu8(xEv, sv);
```

The CONVERT macro handles the second phase mentioned above where
the vectors have to be shifted. This is yet another recursive
macro:

```
  #define CONVERT_1(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label)
    CONVERT_STEP(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label, sv00, Q - 1)

  #define CONVERT_2(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label)
    CONVERT_STEP(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label, sv01, Q - 2)
    CONVERT_1(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label)

  #define CONVERT_3(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label)
    CONVERT_STEP(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label, sv02, Q - 3)
    CONVERT_2(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label)
```

Here, CONVERT_STEP ends up being called on each vector in reverse
order. It does the following:

```
  #define CONVERT_STEP(step, LENGTH_CHECK, label, sv, pos)
    length_check(label)
    rsc = om->sbv[dsq[i]] + pos;
    step()
    sv = _mm_slli_si128(sv, 1);
    sv = _mm_or_si128(sv, beginv);
    i++;
```

First a check is made. This is sometimes used to check whether the
sequence is done. Then the match score pointer is set. After this,
STEP_BANDS is called using the step parameter of this
macro. Finally one vector is shifted and or'ed with the begin
vector of (128, 128, ... ). This ensures that the zero that was
shifted in is converted to the needed base line of 128. Other
entries are not significantly affected by this since either their
most significant bit is already set or we already had an overflow
and it does not matter.

Notice that the CONVERT macro ends up stepping the diagonals w
times, so it handles the whole of phase two. Note also that the
macro may let rsc overflow since it does not reset rsc after a
shift operation. This is handled by extending the match score array
in the P7_OPROFILE by MAX_BANDS - 1 = 17 as defined by the p7O_EXTRA_SB
constant in that file.

The only macro remaining is the CALC macro which just contains the
overall function for going through the various phases. Due to the
starting offset (q), the first Q - q sequence positions have to be
handled separately. After this follows a number of blocks of length
Q where we can be efficient and not do a check of whether the
sequence stops (the NO_CHECK macro indicates this). Finally, at the
end of the sequence we have to be careful and stop at the right
time, again using LENGTH_CHECK.

Even though the code is only around 500 lines, it expands to a
fairly large file when the macros are parsed. For example,
_mm_subs_epi8() is called 6,840 times even though it is only
present once in this file. The object file is still not
ridiculously large.

To better see what is going on, run the preprocessor on this file:

```
  gcc -E ssvfilter.c | sed 's/[;:]/&\n/g' | less
```

Ignore the warnings and go look for the calc_band_2 function.
