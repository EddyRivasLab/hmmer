//! \brief Data structure that represents a shard in memory
/*! \details Shards are the data structures that hold the server's databases in RAM.  Each database is divided into a number of shards 
 * (possibly one), and the sequences or HMMs in the database are distributed round-robin across the shards.  Each worker node is assigned
 * to one shard, and processes the sequences/HMMs in that shard.  Multiple worker nodes may be assigned to process the same shard.
 * 
 * Because shards can hold different types of data, the data fields of each shard are pointers to character arrays, and functions
 * that access shards must cast these pointers to the correct data types before use.  There are two data fields in each shard: contents, 
 * and descriptors.  Data is split in this fashion so that only the data reqired by filters is brought into the cache in the common case
 * where a comparison is not a hit.
 *  
 * When a shard holds sequence data, the contents field holds the actual sequences, in the following format:
 * Sequence ID (8 bytes): Sequence Length (8 bytes) : Sequence data (Sequence length + 2 bytes).  The +2 bytes is because ESL DSQ sequences
 * are padded with sentinel bytes at the beginning and end.  The descriptors field contains the sequences' name (variable length)
 * accession data  (variable length), description (variable length), and taxid (4 bytes)
 * 
 * When a shard holds HMM data, the contents array is an array of pointers to the P7_OPROFILE objects that describe each HMM, and the
 * descriptors array is an array of pointers to the P7_PROFILE objects for each HMM.
 * 
 * The shard also contains a directory, which is an array of structures containing the ID of each object in the shard, the offset from the 
 * start of the contents array to the start of the object's contents data, and the offset from the start of the descriptors array to the 
 * start of the object's data.
 * 
 * An object's ID is its position in the original database, regardless of the number of shards the database is divided into.  Objects must be 
 * loaded into the database in ascending order of ID so that we can use binary search on the directory to locate a particular object.
