// Because MPI doesn't handle variable-length messages that well, we use two broadcasts to initiate an operation
// The first sends a P7_DAEMON_COMMAND structure that tells the workers what type of search they'll be doing, 
// what database to compare against, and how long the object they'll be comparing to is.
// The second sends the object (HMM or sequence) that the workers will be comparing against.


// This is the data structure that the master node broadcasts to all of the workers to tell them to start a search
// The type defines the operation to be performed
#define P7_DAEMON_HMM_VS_SEQUENCES 1 // compare one HMM to a database of squences (hmmsearch)
#define P7_DAEMON_SEQUENCE_VS_HMMS 2 // compare one sequence to a database of HMMs (hmmscan)
#define P7_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN_WORKERS 255 // tell the workers to shut down

// The db field tells the worker which database to search and has range 0 .. <number of databases loaded -1 >
// The compare_obj_length is the length (in bytes) of the HMM or sequence we'll be comparing the database to
