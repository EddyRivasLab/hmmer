/* modelconfig.c
 * Model configuration: the process of converting a core model to a
 * fully configured Plan7 HMM with a "search mode" built into it.
 * 
 * There are four search modes:
 *              single-hit:  multi-hit:
 *              ----------  -----------
 *     local: |     sw          fs
 *    glocal: |      s          ls
 *
 * Additionally, each search mode is configured for a particular
 * target length. Thus "LS/400" means a model configured for glocal,
 * multihit alignment of a target sequence of length 400.
 * 
 * Revised, refactored May 2005: xref STL9/77-81.  
 *   (Uniform fragment length distribution)
 * And then again, Sept 2005:    xref STL10/24-26.

/******************************************************************
 * General notes on model configuration.
 * 
 * When you enter this module, you've got an HMM in "core" probability
 * form: t[], mat[], ins[], and tbd1 are all valid, normalized
 * probabilities. The routines here are used to create the
 * "configured" score form of the model: tsc[], msc[], isc[], bsc[],
 * esc[], and xsc[] fields become valid integer log-odds scores. 
 * 
 * Also in the process, xt[], begin[], and end[] are set to their
 * algorithm-dependent probabilities, though these probabilities are
 * only for reference.  Because of the way the main model's
 * probabilities must be modified to deal with entry/exit
 * probabilities, and because we don't want to modify the core
 * probabilities, we don't ever quite store the full probabilistic
 * model of the configured model, only its log odds scores.
 * 
 * The configuration process breaks down into distinct conceptual steps:
 * 
 * 1. Algorithm configuration.
 *    An "algorithm mode" is chosen. This sets the probabilities in
 *    xt[XTE], begin[], and end[], which determine local/glocal and
 *    multi-hit/single-hit behavior in an HMM alignment to a target
 *    sequence. The "nj" value of the HMM is also set here (the expected
 *    # of times the J state will be used; 0 for single-hit mode and
 *    1 for the default parameterization of multihit modes).
 *    
 * 2. Wing retraction.
 *    In a configured model, the D_1 and D_M states are removed.
 *    The probability of the paths B->D1...->Mk ("BMk") that enter
 *    D1 and use all D's before reaching M_k is treated instead
 *    as an additional dollop of B->Mk entry probability, and the
 *    probability of paths Mk->Dk+1...D_M->E ("MkE") is treated
 *    instead as an additional dollop of Mk->E exit probability.
 *    The MkE path probability is subtracted from the Mk->Dk+1
 *    transition.
 *    
 *    If the algorithm mode is imposing its own local entry/exit
 *    probabilities, then these extra dollops are ignored, and the
 *    model is renormalized appropriately. That is, the algorithm
 *    overrides all B->DDDD->M and/or M->DDDD->E path probabilities
 *    with its own internal entry/exit probabilities.
 *    
 *    If the algorithm mode is "global" at either entry or exit, then
 *    the internal entries are set to BMk and internal exits are set
 *    to MkE, and the model is renormalized appropriately.  That is,
 *    the algorithm treats B->DDDD->M and/or M->DDDD->E path
 *    probabilities as internal entries/exits, instead of allowing
 *    dynamic programming algorithms to use the D_1 or D_M states.
 *    
 *    DP traceback algorithms check whether the model is imposing
 *    internal entry/exit, and construct tracebacks accordingly;
 *    either leaving B->Mk/Mk->E transitions as is, or interpreting
 *    them as B->DDDD->Mk/Mk->DDDD->E paths.
 *    
 *    Wing retraction has two purposes. First, it removes a mute cycle
 *    from the model, B->D1 ...D_M->E, which cannot be correctly and
 *    efficiently dealt with by DP recursions. (A DP algorithm could
 *    simply *ignore* that path though, and throw away the negligible
 *    amount of probability in it. Wing retraction is an elaborate,
 *    overly stylistic alternative that keeps everything fully
 *    probabilistic. Second, it reconciles the algorithm-dependent
 *    entry/exit probabilities with the core model. For algorithms
 *    that impose particular internal entry/exit, you don't want there
 *    to be any additional probability coming from "internal"
 *    B->DDD->M and M->DDD->E paths, so wing retraction takes it away.
 *    
 * 3. Local alignment D-path leveling.
 *    For fully local alignments, we want every fragment ij (starting
 *    at match i, ending from match j) to be equiprobable. There are
 *    M(M+1)/2 possible such fragments, so the probability of each
 *    one is 2/M(M+1). 
 *    
 *    Notionally, we imagine a "model" consisting of the M(M+1)/2
 *    possible fragments, with entry probability of 2/M(M+1) for each.
 *    
 *    Operationally, we achieve this by a trick inspired by a
 *    suggestion from Bill Bruno. Bill suggested that for a model with
 *    no delete states, if we set begin[k] = 1/(M-k+1) and end[k] =
 *    (M-k+1) / [M(M+1)/2], all fragments are equiprobable: the prob
 *    of any given fragment is
 *         b_i * e_j * \prod_{k=i}^{j-1} (1-e_k);
 *    that is, the fragment also includes (j-i) penalizing terms for
 *    *not* ending at i..j-1. Remarkably, this gives the result we
 *    want: this product is always 2/M(M+1), for any ij.
 *    
 *    D->D transitions throw a wrench into this trick, though. A local
 *    alignment that goes M_i->D...D->M_j, for example, only gets
 *    hit with one not-end penalty (for the M_i->D). This means that
 *    paths including deletions will be artifactually favored. 
 *    
 *    The solution is to subtract log(1-e_k) from the deletion
 *    transition scores as well as the match transition scores.  Thus
 *    one log(1-e_k) penalty is always exacted upon transitioning from
 *    any node k->k+1. This is *not* part of the probabilistic model:
 *    it is a score accounting trick that forces the DP algorithms to
 *    associate a log(1-e_k) penalty for each node k->k+1 transition,
 *    which makes the DP calculations give the result desired for our
 *    *notional* probabilistic model with a single 2/M(M+1) transition
 *    for each possible fragment. (A similar accounting trick is the
 *    use of log-odds scoring, where we associate null model
 *    transitions and emissions with appropriate terms in the HMM, to
 *    assure that the final score of any path accounts for all the
 *    desired probability terms in an overall log-odds score). The
 *    overall score of any fragment can be rearranged such that there
 *    is one term consisting of a product of all these penalties * b_i
 *    * e_j = 2/M(M+1), and another term consisting of the actual
 *    model transition path score between i,j.
 *    
 * 4. Target length dependence. 
 *    Given a particular target sequence of length L, we want our HMM score
 *    to be as independent as possible of L. Otherwise, long sequences will
 *    give higher scores, even if they are nonhomologous. 
 *    
 *    The traditional solution to this is Karlin/Altschul statistics,
 *    which tells us that E(s=x) = KMNe^-{\lambda x}, so we expect to
 *    have to make a -1 bit score correction for every 2x increase in
 *    target sequence length (ignoring edge correction effects). K/A
 *    statistics have only been proven for local Viterbi single-hit
 *    ungapped alignments. They have been shown to hold empirically
 *    for local Viterbi single-hit gapped alignments. In my hands 
 *    they also hold for any single-hit alignment (local or glocal, Viterbi
 *    or forward) but they do not hold for multihit alignment modes.
 *    
 *    An alternative solution is to build the length dependence right
 *    into the probabilistic model, since we have a full probabilistic
 *    model of the target sequence. We match the expected lengths of
 *    the model M and the null model R by setting the p1, N, C, and J
 *    transitions appropriately. R has to emit the whole sequence, so
 *    it has a self-transition of L/(L+1). N, C, and J have to emit
 *    (L-(k+1)x) residues of the sequence, where x is the expected length
 *    of an alignment to the core model, and k is the expected number
 *    of times that we cycle through the J state. k=0 in sw mode, and k=1
 *    in fs/ls mode w/ the standard [XTE][LOOP] probability of 0.5. 
 *    
 * 5. Conversion of probabilities to integer log-odds scores.
 *    This step incorporates the contribution of the null model,
 *    and converts floating-point probs to the scaled integer log-odds
 *    score values that are used by the DP alignment routines. 
 *    
 * Step 1 is done by the main Plan7*Config() functions, which come in sw,
 * ls, fs, s, and "naked" flavors.
 *
 * Step 2 is done by the *wing_retraction*() functions, which also
 *  go ahead and convert the affected transitions to log-odds scores;
 *  left wing retraction sets bsc[], right wing retraction sets
 *  esc[] and tsc[TM*].
 *  
 * Step 3 is carried out by one of two delete path accounting routines,
 *  which go ahead and set tsc[TD*].
 *  
 * Step 4 is carried out by the target_ldependence() routine.
 * 
 * Step 5 is carried out for all remaining scores by logoddsify_the_rest().   
 * 
 * The model never exists in a configured probability form. The core
 * model is in probabilities; the configured model is in scores. In
 * fact, because a fully local model uses delete path score
 * accounting, you shouldn't even try to backcalculate probabilities
 * from these scores, at least for local models -- the probabilistic model
 * underlying fully local alignment is an implicit one that cannot
 * be represented in the profile HMM structure.
 *
 * So, overall, to find where the various scores and probs are set:
 *   bsc      :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   esc      :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   tsc[TM*] :  wing retraction          (section 2)
 *   tsc[TI*] :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 4)
 *   tsc[TD*] :  dpath leveling           (section 3)
 *   p1       :  target_ldependence()     (section 4)  
 *   xt[NCJ]  :  target_ldependence()     (section 4)  
 *   xsc (all):  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 4)
 *   msc      :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 5)
 *   isc      :  logoddsify_the_rest()    (section 5)

 *            350. It should be set to the actual length of each target
 *            sequence by a call to <P7ReconfigLength()>.
 *            
 *            The configuration-dependent model probability params are

 *            probabilities are set, for reference only. (Because the
 *            main model transition probabilities may be implicitly
 *            renormalized as scores are calculated, because of added
 *            <M->E> transitions, wing retraction, and d-path
 *            leveling, the HMM structure does not store an explicit
 *            full probabilistic model of the search-configured HMM;

 *            probabilistic model.
 *            
 *            If necessary (for numerical reasons), the <PLAN7_LCORRECT>
 *            flag will be raised on the model. This indicates that we

/*****************************************************************
 * Section 1. The API: plan7's algorithm mode configuration functions.
 *
 * The following few functions are the Plan7 equivalent of choosing
 * different alignment styles (fully local, fully global,
 * global/local, multihit, etc.)
 * 
 * When you come into a configuration routine, the following
 * probabilities are valid in the model:
 *    1. t[1..M-1][0..6]: all the state transitions.
 *       (Node M is special: it has only a match and a delete state,
 *       no insert state, and M_M->E = 1.0 and D_M->E = 1.0 by def'n.)
 *    2. mat[1..M][]:  all the match emissions.
 *    3. ins[1..M-1][]: all the insert emissions. Note that there is
 *       no insert state in node M.
 *    4. tbd1: the B->D1 probability. The B->M1 probability is 1-tbd1.
 * These are the "data-dependent" probabilities in the model.
 * 
 * The configuration routine gets to set the "algorithm-dependent"
 * probabilities:
 *    1. xt[XTN][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls unaligned N-terminal seq.
 *       The higher xt[XTN][LOOP] is, the more unaligned seq we allow.
 *       Similarly, xt[XTC][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls unaligned C-terminal 
 *       seq, and xt[XTJ][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls length of unaligned sequence
 *       between multiple copies of a domain. Normally, if these are nonzero,
 *       they are all set to be equal to hmm->p1, the loop probability
 *       for the null hypothesis (see below).
 *    2. xt[XTE][MOVE,LOOP] dist controls multihits. 
 *       Setting xt[XTE][LOOP] to 0.0 forces one hit per model.
 *    3. begin[1..M] controls entry probabilities. An algorithm 
 *       mode either imposes internal begin probabilities, or leaves begin[1] 
 *       as 1.0 and begin[k] = 0.0 for k>1.
 *    4. end[1..M] controls exit probabilities. An algorithm mode either
 *       imposes internal exit probabilities, or leaves end[M] = 1.0
 *       and end[k] = 0.0 for k<M.
 *    
 * The configuration routine then calls routines as appropriate to set
 * up all the model's scores, given these configured probabilities. When
 * the config routine returns, all scores are ready for alignment:
 * bsc, esc, tsc, msc, isc, and xsc.
 * 
 *****************************************************************
 *
 * There is (at least) one more issue worth noting.
 * If you want per-domain scores to sum up to per-sequence scores, which is
 * generally desirable if you don't want "bug" reports from vigilant users,
 * then one of the following two sets of conditions must be met:
 *   
 *   1) t(E->J) = 0    
 *      e.g. no multidomain hits
 *      
 *   2) t(N->N) = t(C->C) = t(J->J) = hmm->p1 
 *      e.g. unmatching sequence scores zero, and 
 *      N->B first-model score is equal to J->B another-model score.
 *      
 * These constraints are obeyed in the default Config() functions below,
 * but in the future (say, when HMM editing may be allowed) we'll have
 * to remember this. Non-equality of the summed domain scores and
 * the total sequence score is a really easy "red flag" for people to
 * notice and report as a bug, even if it may make probabilistic
 * sense not to meet either constraint for certain modeling problems.

 * 
 * Purpose:  Set the alignment independent parameters of

 *           
 * Notes:    The desideratum for begin/end probs is that all fragments ij
 *           (starting at match i, ending at match j) are
 *           equiprobable -- there is no information in the choice of
 *           entry/exit. There are M(M+1)/2 possible choices of ij, so
 *           each must get a probability of 2/M(M+1). This prob is the
 *           product of a begin, an end, and all the not-end probs in
 *           the path between i,j. 
 *            
 *           Thus: entry/exit is asymmetric because of the left/right
 *           nature of the HMM/profile. Entry probability is distributed
 *           simply by assigning p_x = pentry / (M-1) to M-1 
 *           internal match states. However, the same approach doesn't
 *           lead to a flat distribution over exit points. Exit p's
 *           must be corrected for the probability of a previous exit
 *           from the model. Requiring a flat distribution over exit
 *           points leads to an easily solved piece of algebra, giving:
 *                      p_1 = pexit / (M-1)

 * SRE, Fri May 13 13:08:18 2005 [St. Louis]
 *
 * Edge effect correction, Bill Bruno's version, slightly modified.
 * Calculate and return effective sequence length L', given the real
 * length <L> and a length distribution for optimal alignments.  This
 * length distribution P(x) is assumed to be a left-censored Gaussian
 * with mean <kappa> and std deviation <sigma>, x > 0.
 *            
 * Args:      L     - target sequence length in residues (cast to double)
 *            kappa - mean alignment length
 *            sigma - std dev on alignment length
 *
 * Returns:   L', the effective sequence length.
 *
 * Discussion: BLAST's edge correction is L-l(s); subtract the
 *            alignment length from L, where l(s) is the expected
 *            length of an alignment that scores s. l(s), in turn,
 *            is assumed to be a linear function of s: l(s) =
 *            alpha * s + beta. [Altschul01] discusses this
 *            correction, and how alpha can alternatively be used to
 *            calculate an edge correction on lambda, instead of an
 *            edge correction on L. 
 *            
 *            Bill Bruno points out that this can break down for small
 *            target sequence lengths L, especially for L<l(s), where
 *            you'd calculate a negative effective seq length (which
 *            then gives you a negative probability for the P-value
 *            from K/A statistics).
 *            
 *            Bill suggested instead calculating the expected effective
 *            seq length, integrating over all possible alignment
 *            lengths, rather than assuming a single fixed length l(s).
 *            
 *            We assume that alignment lengths l(s) are distributed as a
 *            left-censored Gaussian, l(s) > 0, with mean kappa and std
 *            deviation sigma.
 *            
 *            Then, N' =   \int_0^N (N-x) Prob(x | k,s) dx
 *                        ----------------------------------
 *                       1 - \int_{-\infty}^0 Prob(x | k,s) dx
 *                       
 *            This function implements the solution of this equation.
 *            See STL9/92-93 for the derivation.
 * 
 *            (The distribution of alignment lengths is not Gaussian,
 *            though; it's closer to gamma. And it's not simply truncated
 *            at small lengths. Not sure any more that this function is
 *            well justified. xref STL10/59.)
 *            
 * Portability: Requires erf() -- double erf(double x) -- the error
 *            function of x. erf() is in ISO C99 spec, but is not ANSI
 *            C or POSIX.
