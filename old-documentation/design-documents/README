This directory contains design documents for different pieces of HMMER 4.  
They are currently under development and may be incoherent, fragmentary or just
plain wrong.

These documents require the R package "knitr" and the Python package
"Pygmentize" to build.  If we include these documents in the release version of
HMMER 4, we will ship them as PDFs, both to prevent changes and to eliminate 
dependencies on external tools.
