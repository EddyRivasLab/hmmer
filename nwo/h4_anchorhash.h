/* H4_ANCHORHASH: an auxiliary data structure that the MPAS (most probable anchor
 * set) algorithm uses, to know quickly when it's sampled an anchor set that it's
 * already scored.
 *
 * Patterned on ESL_KEYHASH implementation.
 * Pointerless, to facilitate copying.
 *
 * Each "element" we store is one anchor array, of 2D+1 integers:
 *     D [i0(1),k0(1)]..[i0(D),k0(D)]
 * Each element is associated with a unique integer key, 0..nkeys-1.
 *
 * <amem> consists of packed data for all stored elements. 
 * <an> is the total number of integers stored in amem now.
 * 
 * Data element <k=0..nkeys-1> starts at amem+key_offset[k].  We use offsets, rather
 * than pointers, because we may need to reallocate <amem>, which would invalidate
 * pointers.
 * 
 * To read the data from element <k>, you first read its <D> at
 * *(amem+key_offset[k]), then read <D> integer (i0,k0) pairs.
 * 
 * Anchor sets come with leading (d=0) and trailing (d=D+1) sentinels, set to (0,M+1)
 * and (L+1,0). We assume that all anchor sets are for the same profile/sequence
 * comparison, so the anchorhash just stores L,M itself instead of storing the
 * trailing sentinels for every anchorset.
 * 
 * Each anchorset is hashed, generating a hash value from 0..hashsize-1, and these
 * integer keys are stored in a hashtable of linked lists.  hashtable[z] is the head
 * node of the list for hash value z.  It's either -1 if the list is empty, or a key,
 * 0..nkeys-1.  The linked list is implemented by having <nxt> values for each key;
 * also -1 (no more keys in list) or a key 0..nkeys-1.  Again, implementing this in
 * terms of keys, not pointers, is important because we will need to reallocate
 * memory sometimes.
 * 
 * Example: 
 *   suppose we've stored 2 different anchor sets for seq of length 100
 *   and a model of length 85.
 *   1. Two domains,  (42,61) and (71,53)
 *   2. Three domains,(23,37), (43,62), and (70,52)
 * then:
 *   amem[]  = 2 42 61 71 53 3 23 37 43 62 70 52
 *   an      = 12
 *   aalloc >= 12
 *   
 *   key_offset[] = { 0, 5 }
 *   nkeys        = 2
 *   kalloc       >= 2
 *   
 *   hashtable    = { -1 ... 0 ... -1 ... 1 ... -1 }
 *   nxt[]        = -1 -1
 *   
 *   L            = 100
 *   M            = 85
 *
 * Note: structure is suitable for becoming more general, a hash
 *  of any integer array.
 *
 * We also keep <key_count[k]>, the number of times that <_Store()>
 * has been called for each different key <k>. This allows debug/test
 * code to compare the observed frequency of an anchor set with its
 * calculated probability. Production code doesn't need it, but
 * overhead is negligible.
