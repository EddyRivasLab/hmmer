/* Function:  h4_EntropyWeight()
 * Synopsis:  Determine effective sequence number before parameterizing new profile. 
 * Incept:    SRE, Fri 05 Apr 2019 [Caro Emerald, Back It Up]
 *
 * Purpose:   Use "entropy weighting" to calculate an effective sequence
 *            number, and return it in <*ret_Neff>. 
 *            
 *            We're given a count-collection <ctm> that contains
 *            observed counts for a new profile we're building, the
 *            prior <pri> that we're going to use to convert counts to
 *            probability parameters, and the number of sequences
 *            <nseq> that we got the counts from.  We look at the
 *            average bitscore per match emission distribution, and
 *            aim to reduce it to <etarget> bits by making <Neff>
 *            something less than <nseq>.
 *            
 *            If the alignment was so diverse that the average
 *            bitscore per match state was already <= <etarget>, <Neff
 *            = nseq>.
 *            
 *            The result <Neff> is on the half-closed interval
 *            (0,nseq]. The caller will probably then scale the counts
 *            in the HMM by <Neff/nseq> before parameterizing the new
 *            profile. 
 *            
 *            Uses the Easel bisection rootfinder. 
 *
 * Args:      ctm      - counts that were collected
 *            pri      - mixture Dirichlet prior that'll be used
 *            nseq     - # of seqs that were counted into <hmm>
 *            etarget  - target mean bitscore per match state
 *            ret_Neff - RETURN: effective sequence number, (0,nseq]
 *
 * Returns:   <eslOK> on success, and <*ret_Neff> is the solution
 *            for effective sequence number.
 *
 * Throws:    <eslEMEM> on allocation failure.
 *
 *            <eslEINVAL> if there's no solution; if no value of Neff
 *            can reduce the mean bitscore/position to <etarget>.  (I
 *            don't think this can happen here, but the Easel
 *            rootfinder pays attention to this possibility).
 *
 *            <eslENOHALT> if no solution is found in time, given the
 *            Easel rootfinder's limit on max number of iterations.
 *            This shouldn't ever happen either.
 * 
 *            On any exception, if exceptions are handled with a
 *            nonfatal handler, <*ret_Neff> is set to <nseq>.
