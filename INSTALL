Starting from a distribution "with binaries", such as 
hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@-linux-intel-x86_64.tar.gz:
   uncompress hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@-xyz.tar.gz  
   tar xf hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@-xyz.tar
   cd hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@-xyz
 
The pre-compiled binaries are found in the directory ./binaries.
You may copy these into a directory of your choosing, or simply add
this directory to your $PATH variable.

Starting from a source distribution, hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar.gz:
   uncompress hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar.gz  
   tar xf hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@.tar
   cd hmmer-@HMMER_VERSION@
   ./configure
   make
   make check                        # optional: automated tests

HMMER is developed primarily on Linux and Mac OS/X systems. It is
tested on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. It is
written in ANSI C99 conforming to POSIX standards. It is meant to be
portable to any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99 compiler,
including all UNIX and Macintosh systems. A binary version is also
available for Windows systems with Cygwin installed (Cygwin is 
optional POSIX compatibility software).
