------------------------------------------

These are quick installation instructions. For complete documentation,
see the Installation chapter in the HMMER User's Guide (Userguide.pdf).

For a source distribution (hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar.gz):

 uncompress hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar.gz  Uncompresses the archive.
 tar xf hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar         Unpacks the archive. 
                                    (makes a new directory, hmmer-@RELEASE@)
 cd hmmer-@RELEASE@                 Moves into the distribution directory.
 ./configure                   Configures the software for your system.
 make                          Builds the binaries. 
 make check                    Runs the test suite to test the new binaries.
 make install                  Installs the software. (You may need to be root.)
 It should build cleanly on just about any UNIX machine.



For a binary distribution (hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.<platform>-<os>.tar.gz),
for example, the sun-solaris distro:

  uncompress hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.sun-solaris.tar.Z
  tar xf hmmer-@RELEASE@.bin.sun-solaris.tar
  cd hmmer-@RELEASE@

     The programs are linked in the binaries/ subdirectory;
     man pages are in the documentation/man subdirectory;
     and the userguide is Userguide.pdf. 

     Optionally, you can test the software:

  make check
     
     And you can configure it with installation paths, and install 
     it. The default is to put programs in /usr/local/bin and man pages
     in /usr/local/man. To change these, see the instructions in
     Userguide.pdf for providing alternative paths to the ./configure
     script:
  
  ./configure
  make install

    HMMER doesn't depend on any external data files, so the installation is
    simple - the binaries are free standing. You can install
    them anywhere you like, just by using cp or mv if you like.
