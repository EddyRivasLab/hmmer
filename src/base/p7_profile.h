/* Whereas the core HMM is a model of a single global alignment to a
 * homologous domain, a profile is a model of local and glocal homologous
 * alignments embedded in a longer sequence. The profile is constructed
 * from the core HMM by adding nine additional states: 
 *
 *   S->N->B-->L ... -->E->C->T
 *          \_>G ... _/ |
 *         ^            |
 *         |____ J _____|
 *
 * These nine states control the "algorithm-dependent" configuration
 * of the profile and of our alignment/scoring algorithms (Viterbi or 
 * Forward). There are three components to this configuration:
 *     1. The length model:
 *          N,C,J transitions control the expected length of
 *          nonhomologous sequence segments. The length model is
 *          typically reset for each new target sequence length L.
 *     2. Multihit vs. unihit
 *          The E transitions control whether the model is allowed
 *          to loop around for multiple homology segments per
 *          target sequence. Usually we're multihit.
 *     3. Search mode: local vs. glocal paths
 *          The B->L, B->G probabilities control whether the model
 *          only allows local alignment, only allows glocal alignment,
 *          or a mixture of the two. Usually we're "dual-mode"
 *          with 50/50 probability of local vs. glocal.
 *         
 * For efficiency, two of the nine states (S,T) only appear in our
 * formal state diagrams. They are not explicitly represented in the
 * P7_PROFILE parameters that DP calculations use:
 *     1. The S->N probability is always 1.0, so our DP codes 
 *        initialize on the N state and don't store anything for S.
 *     2. The C->T log probability is added on to any final 
 *        lod score. We know the T state only has nonzero probability
 *        at position i=L in the target, so DP algorithms don't
 *        bother to store it in their matrix.
 *        
 * The profile is missing some states of the core HMM:
 *     1. The D1 state is removed by "wing retraction".
 *     2. The I0 and Im states aren't present.
 * Transition costs from the I0/Im states are initialized to -inf.
 * Transition costs from the D1 state are present in the P7_PROFILE
 * data structure, but unused by DP algorithms; see the "wing 
 * retraction" section below for an explanation.
 *     
 * Some alignment/scoring DP implementations may implicitly override the
 * length model, multihit mode, or the search mode (so long as they
 * document it). Examples:
 *     1. For the length model, we sometimes make the approximation
 *          that there are ~L NN/CC/JJ transitions (assuming the
 *          target sequence length is large enough that the sum 
 *          of homologous segment lengths is negligible). This
 *          allows what the code calls the "3 nat" or "2 nat"
 *          approximation: L \log \frac{L}{L+3} ~ 3.0 (multihit mode),
 *          L \log \frac{L}{L+2} ~ 2.0 (unihit mode).
 *     2. To override multihit/unihit mode: Multihit vs. unihit mode
 *          also affects the length model parameters, so the
 *          algorithm must not only replace tEC/tEJ parameters, but
 *          must also use appropriate N,C,J parameters. The MSV
 *          filter (impl_xxx/msvfilter.c) is an example where the
 *          algorithm is always multihit, and where NN,CC,JJ 
 *          parameters are handled implicitly w/ the 3-nat approximation.
 *     3. To override search mode and use only one path (local or
 *          glocal): The algorithm ignores the tBL/tBG log probability
 *          and evaluates the path it wants as if it had B->L or B->G
 *          set to 1.0.
 *          
 * The full (dual-mode, local/glocal) model is only implemented in
 * P7_PROFILE, not in a vectorized P7_OPROFILE. Vector implementations
 * are always and only in local alignment mode, because of numeric
 * range limitations. Vector implementations are only used for fast
 * filtering before a final banded calculation with the full model.
 *          
 * Wing retraction:        
 *   For the local path, all algorithms must use the L->Mk "uniform"
 *   entry distribution, and assume that all Mk->E and Dk->E are
 *   1.0. The L->Mk entry distribution supersedes all paths involving
 *   terminal deletion. This is the "implicit probabilistic model"
 *   of local alignment [Eddy08].  The D_1 and I_M states don't exist
 *   on the local path, and algorithms must treat them as zero probability.
 * 
 *   For the glocal path, all algorithms must use a G->Mk "wing
 *   retracted" entry distribution <p7P_GM>, and some algorithms may
 *   optionally use a DGk+1->E wing retracted exit distribution
 *   <p7P_DGE>. Wing retracted entry G->Mk is required, because this is
 *   the way we remove a mute cycle (B->G->D1..Dm->E->J->B) from the
 *   profile: by removing the D1 state and neglecting the probability
 *   of the mute cycle in all DP calculations.
 *      
 *   Wing retracted entry, see modelconfig.c::set_glocal_entry()
 *      tGM1 = log t(G->M1) 
 *      tGMk = log t(G->D1) + \sum_j={1..k-2} log t(Dj->Dj+1) + log t(Dk-1->Mk)
 *      stored off-by-one: tGMk is stored at TSC(p7P_GM, k-1) in profile structure.
 *      
 *   Wing retracted exit, see modelconfig.c::set_glocal_exit()
 *      tDGkE = log t(Dk+1->...Dm->E)
 *            = \sum_j={k+1..m-1} log t(Dj->Dj+1)    (recall that Dm->E = 1.0)
 *      valid for k=0..M: 
 *      boundary conditions:
 *      TSC(DGE,M) = TSC(DGE,M-1) = 0    
 *   
 *   Wing retracted exits are used in sparse DP calculations: see
 *   sparse_fwdback.c. A DP calculation may also use Mm->E and Dm->E
 *   (both 1.0) explicitly, rather than using the DGE wing retracted
 *   exit.  The reference implementation does this, for example (see
 *   reference_fwdback.c or reference_viterbi.c).
 *
 *   Wing retraction is only used internally in DP implementations.
 *   Any resulting tracebacks (alignments) still represent a
 *   G->D1...Dk-1->Mk entry explicitly; you'll see this in traceback
 *   code, where it adds k-1 delete states to a trace whenever it sees
 *   a G->Mk entry.  Thus we may still need the D1->{DM}
 *   parameterization, to call p7_trace_Score() for example; and so,
 *   even though the D1 state is implicitly removed by all DP
 *   implementations, on both the local and glocal paths, its
 *   parameterization is still present in the P7_PROFILE.
