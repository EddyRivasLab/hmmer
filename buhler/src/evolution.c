/* Function:  EvolveOneTransitionVector()
 * Incept:    SRE, Sun Oct 31 08:15:02 2004 [St. Louis]
 *
 * Purpose:   Implementation of Rivas' evolutionary modeling of a model transition
 *            process [Rivas05].
 *            
 *            Given: at a nontrivial time t* (ts), a transition vector
 *            q* (qs). Also given, assertions of the transition vector (q0)
 *            at time 0, and the stationary vector q_\infty (qz) at time 
 *            infinity.
 *            
 *            Each component 0..i..n of the three vectors must obey one
 *            of these three conditions:
 *                q0[i] < qs[i] < qz[i]
 *                q0[i] > qs[i] > qz[i]
 *                q0[i] = qs[i] = qz[i]
 *            (because all we're really doing is fitting each component
 *            independently to an exponential decay/accumulation curve.)
 *            (Note that this is not an "evolutionary model" in the sense that
 *            multiplicativity will not hold.)
 *            
 *            Each probability vector must also be properly normalized
 *            (\sum = 1). The code does not check this.
 *            
 *            Calculate: for some given time t, calculate and return a new
 *            transition vector, q.
 *            
 * Method:    [Rivas05] expresses the calculation in matrix form; but can
 *            also think of it as fitting independent exponential curves
 *            starting from q0[i], asymptoting to qz[i], while passing through
 *            qs[i].
 *            
 * Args:      qs:   probability vector at time t*
 *            ts:   time t* (typically set to 1.0 by convention, but could
 *                  also be something in units of substitutions/site or PAMs)
 *            n:    # of elements in q vectors.
 *            q0:   probability vector at time 0
 *            qz:   probability vector at time infinity
 *            t:    desired time.
 *            q:    RETURN: probability vector at time t.
 *
 * Returns:   On success: returns 1, and q contains the vector at time t; 
 *
 *            If a component of the vector doesn't obey one of the necessary
 *            conditions, returns 0.
