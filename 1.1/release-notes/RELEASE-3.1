Interim notes for upcoming 3.1 release
so stuff doesn't get forgotten that needs to be noted...


Small changes that nonetheless affect output:
(watch out for, if you are running regression tests)

-:- Multiple alignment outputs now always include all consensus
    columns, even if that column is all gaps. This simplifies
    downstream processing for a lot of people's parsers, who may be
    expecting to be able to map a query's consensus coordinate system
    unambiguously onto a new alignment.
 
    The hmmalign --allcol option (which did the above as an option)
    has been removed.

    To get the original behavior, you can use esl-reformat --mingap to
    remove all-gap columns from an alignment.

-:- The "bias" score values in all output formats, for both
    per-sequence and per-domain outputs, were erroneously
    reported in nat units in 3.0, whereas all other scores are
    bit scores. 3.1 now corrects this; the bias values
    are in units of bits.


Bugfixes:

-:- #h79 Resizing a generic dynamic programming matrix with
         p7_gmx_GrowTo() could result in memory corruption. This
         function was not called in production H3 code, so the bug
         only appears in test code or other H3-based code derivatives
         (such as Elena Rivas' mouse vocalization recognizer, which is
         where the bug was caught).

-:- #h80 hmmconvert was unable to read HMMER2 "Nucleic" save files,
	 because H3 uses "DNA" or "RNA" as an alphabet label rather
	 than H2's generic old "Nucleic".

-:- #h81 "dombias" value in output files was being reported in nats.
         All score output is supposed to be reported in bits.

-:- #h82 hmmbuild was corrupting resaved alignments if a target
         sequence contained all insert residues and no consensus.

-:- #h83 Command line E-value threshold options only worked down to
         ~1e-30 or so because of some errant casts of internal
         P-values to single-precision floats. All P-values are
         supposed to be double precision, ranging down to ~1e-308.
