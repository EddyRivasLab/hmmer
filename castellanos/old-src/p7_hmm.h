/* Structure: P7_HMM 
 *    
 * 2. The "configured" model is the scoring form.
 *    It adds the S,N,B; J; E,C,T special states of the Plan7
 *    "algorithm-dependent" probability architecture.
 *    
 *    The S and T states are not explicitly represented anywhere.
 *    S->N is implicitly 1.0. 
 *    
 *    N,E,C,J transitions are set in xt[]. N,C,J emissions are implicitly
 *    equal to the null model emission probabilities, and these states emit
 *    on transition. 
 *    
 *    Entry into the model is controlled by begin[], which is a normalized
 *    prob distribution \sum_{k=1}^{k=M} t(B->M_k) = 1.0. Exit from the model
 *    is controlled by end[], which is not a probability distribution itself;
 *    rather, \sum_{x=MDI} t(M_k->x) + t(M_k->E) = 1.0. 
 *    
 *    A configured model has no D_1 or D_M state. A process called
 *    "wing retraction" is applied by the configuration functions, to
 *    eliminate the mute all-delete B->D_1...D_M->E path. Wing
 *    retraction requires altering the transition probabilities in the
 *    nodes. See modelconfig.c.
 *    
 *    Only two combinations of wing retraction and internal entry/exit
 *    are allowed. In sw/fs mode models, algorithm-dependent entry and
 *    exit probabilities partially trump wing retraction, so begin[]
 *    and end[] are unaffected, though other effects of wing
 *    retraction take place; in an alignment, all B->M_k and M_k->E
 *    begins and exits are interpreted literally as B->M_k and M_k->E
 *    transitions. In ls/s mode models, there is no algorithmic
 *    internal entry/exit probability, but wing retraction contributes
 *    data-dependent probability to begin[] and [end]; in an
 *    alignment, B->M_k and M_k->E internal begins/ends are
 *    interpreted instead as delete paths B->D1->...->D_k-1->M_k or
 *    M_k->D_k+1->...->D_M->E.  That is, internal entry and exit probs
 *    may only be *entirely* algorithm dependent (from configuration)
 *    or *entirely* data-dependent (from wing retraction of the core
 *    model), not a mixture of both. (The reason is that if they're a
 *    sum of the two, you can't correctly extract a Viterbi alignment
 *    from the sum.) When the configuration is using
 *    algorithm-dependent entry, the PLAN7_BIMPOSED flag is raised;
 *    when it is using algorithm-dependent exit, the PLAN7_EIMPOSED
 *    flag is raised.  (xref STL9/79, and modelconfig.c).
 *    
 *    After configuration, the core model is unchanged; xt, begin, end
 *    are set to probabilities; and bsc, esc, tsc, msc, isc, and & xsc
 *    are set to scores. In a configured model, tbd1 is not used (all
 *    entry into the model is controlled by B->M_k begins); D_1 and
 *    D_M don't exist and aren't used; D_M-1->M_M = 1.0 and M_M-1->D_M
 *    = 0.0 (because D_M doesn't exist); and all exits from the model
 *    are controlled by M_k->E ends.
 *    
 *    The PLAN7_HASBITS flag is up when the model is configured into
 *    score form.
 *    
 * hmmbuild creates a core model, then configures it, then saves
 * it. Both the core model and the configured model are saved.
 * 
 * Search programs like hmmpfam and hmmsearch read only the configured
 * score model, usually ignoring the core probability model.
