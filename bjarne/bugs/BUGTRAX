DESCRIPTION     
   Original email report shows a jackhmmer segfault that appeared
   fairly obscure -- only with certain queries, only in jackhmmer.
   Traced to a segfault when using esl_msa_SetSeqDescription()
   to copy a seq description to a new MSA. This reveals a general
   flaw in the entire {msa,seq}_Set* functions -- they can't be used
   to copy a string that might contain a naked '%', from user
   input outside program's control.
   
   Requires changing the {msa,sq} API: _Set* functions changed to
   _Format*; new _Set* functions take a const string, not a
   printf()-style format string and varargs.

DESCRIPTION     
   hmmscan tabular domain output reverses target and query lengths.

   P7_ALIDISPLAY stores actual L and M of sequence and HMM, but
   tabular domain output is query and target lengths. hmmsearch has
   HMM query, seq targets; hmmscan has seq query, HMM targets.
   p7_tophits_TabularTargets() needs to set tlen, qlen using
   PIPELINE's {p7_SEARCH_SEQS | p7_SCAN_MODELS} flag.

DESCRIPTION     
  jackhmmer fails at p7_alidisplay.c line 422 with error message, 
  "backconverted subseq didn't end at expected length".

  Seidl sends an example involving a large FASTA database. 

  Turns out to be a problem with * characters; Seidl's db is full of
  them, and his example is one that puts a * in an insertion in an
  otherwise highly significant alignment. A routine that is supposed
  to be counting residue lengths was failing to count the *, so it
  was getting the wrong length.

   Initially this did not seem to reproduce, because I was testing
   current dev code, not alpha2 code. Now I've reproduced it not only
   on AMD Opteron (cf-suse; close to Williams' machine) and even on
   the desktop, using alpha2 code. beta1 code does not show the same
   bug. Attributable to the change to autoconf 2.63; autoconf 2.61
   (used by alpha2) had a bug in how it detected ftello().

DESCRIPTION     
  Domain definition could result in nregions>0 and nenvelopes==0 and
  thus no available domain information if the region(s) were handled
  by stochastic traceback clustering; this resulted in passing the
  nregions==0 failsafe in p7_pipeline, uninitialized domain info
  fields in tophits structure, and segfaults and/or valgrind bleating
  when top sequence hit output routines try to access at least one
  best domain.

  Fix is to add a check for nenvelopes==0 in addition to (could be in
  lieu of) nregions==0 failsafe.

DESCRIPTION     
 Domain definition failure; it's finding two copies of exactly the
 same domain.
 
 Remmert saw this with jackhmmer -A, where the output alignment can't
 be parsed because it has a dup name in it.

 Simpler reproduction:
   phmmer d1bd8a_.seq bug.fa

 Domain hits include:
  3 !   22.2   0.1   6.5e-09   6.5e-09      48     151 ..     191     262 ..     145     266 .. 0.57

 There was a bug in "domain domination" logic in
 p7_domaindef.c::region_trace_ensemble(): ESL_MIN(len(d), len(d2) was
 doing ESL_MIN(len(d), len(d)) and failing to detect many cases of
 dominated domains.

  produces no hits with 3.0a2 code, but 3.0a1 code sees a hit, as does
  hmmscan --max or hmmscan --nobias.

  Problem is that esl_hmm_Configure() doesn't set degenerate residue
  scores properly. I introduced this bug in r326, when I allowed a
  NULL fq[] array to default to uniform background
  frequencies. Background frequency of degenerate residues wasn't
  being summed correctly, resulting in scores getting set to garbage.

  Problem exists from Easel r326 to r331. Fixed in r332.

Hey Sean!

I hope you are well. Just FYI, this could be somehow my fault, but at  
the tail of every hmm* program of HMMER3 on MacOSX, x86_64, which I  
recompiled from your source using icc as you suggested (which gave a  
ton of "option -xk not supported" warnings"), I get the little error:

  The problem appears to be that IBM AIX inscrutably limits 32-bit
  applications to one 256 MB data segment of memory by default.  On
  hanni, w/ 8 processors and a RAMLIMIT of 32 MB/proc, this limitation
  is exposed.  This memory limitation needs to be lifted. There are
  three options:

  1. Compile w/ xlc_r -q64 flag, to create a 64-bit executable. 
     ar needs -X64 flag as well, to archive 64-bit object files.
     Manually modify AR command in Makefile.in in hmmer/ and squid/
     subdirs.

  2. Compile w/ xlc_r -bmaxdata:0x80000000 flag, to make a 32-bit
     executable w/ "large memory model".

  3. Don't run that many cpus; use --cpu <n> flag.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmpfam crashes on Pfam_fs w/ "FATAL: you can't init get_wee_midpt
  with a T", on a long HMM Arena_RNA_pol.

  The problem is that P7WeeViterbi() is called w/ subseq of L=1. The
  init of P7WeeViterbi sets begin,end points initially to STS, STT;
  but when 1==L, assignment of tassign[L] to STT clobbers tassign[1].

  Fixing this properly will require rethinking get_wee_midpt carefully.

  Instead, hack around it. P7WeeViterbi() is only called once, from
  within P7SmallViterbi(). Insert an extra test; if sqlen==1, do not
  call P7WeeViterbi(), instead allocate a tiny L=1 matrix and use 
  P7Viterbi().

  Document P7WeeViterbi(): it can't take L=1.

DESCRIPTION     
  Turned up in SPEC certification process. Alan L. MacKay
  <amackay@us.ibm.com>, of IBM AIX Compilers/Performance group, sends
  an Insure++ report that shows a case where dsq[] was a negative
  number. Kaivalya reports that they "fixed" this by forcing compilers
  to use unsigned chars by default. A confusing discussion ensues;
  MacKay thinks the problem is the use of char dsq[] as an array index,
  whereas I think the code "guarantees" nonnegative dsq[] and that
  there isn't a problem here; I think the crash IBM saw was coming
  from memory corruption due to bug #h25.

  Nonetheless, he has a point: if I'm going to use dsq[] as an array
  index, it would be better coding practice to declare it as 
  unsigned char.

  Changed dsq from char to unsigned char throughout (and some
  instances of sym, symidx). Removed (int) casts whereever dsq[],
  symidx were being used as array indices.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmpfam search with 125,000aa sequence eventually crashes 
  because of lack of RAM, instead of successfully using small
  memory routines.

  Problem is that the code assumed that M,N can't both grow in
  allocating a matrix, but that's not true in hmmpfam; after P7SmallViterbi(),
  we may hand various sized bits of sequence off for subalignment,
  with different sized models.

  Wrote P7ViterbiSpaceOK(); used it instead of P7ViterbiSize() to switch
  between normal and small variants; allow creation routine to grow in M
  and N (padM and padN can both be positive); make initial allocs for 
  hmmpfam matrices to be 300x300, to avoid pathologically asymmetric
  matrices.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmsearch crashes unpredictably on Swissprot searches (EMBL
  format).

  AMD contributes an Insure++ report showing three problems:
  1. Alphabet[] is not a string but is being passed to strchr();
  2. readEMBL is looking for a \0 in a growing seq, but a growing
     seq has no \0 until ReadSeq() polishes it off;
  3. xmx[] is shown as a dangling/wild ptr in core_algorithms.c 
     and fast_algorithms.c.
  AMD and/or Intel also indicate, via Kaivalya, that the problem
  is in sqio.c: they explicitly nul-terminate after every reallocation
  of the seq, and the problem disappears.
  Fixed problems 1 and 2. Can't find the problem that Insure++ is
  bitching about for 3; worrying. Bug goes away: it was clearly the result
  of problem 2. Bugs in #1 should only appear for databases with
  nonstandard residues.

CLOSED_DATE     SRE, Fri Jun  6 18:56:43 2003
DESCRIPTION     
 Original report cited difference in E-values between 
 IBM 2.2g binaries and 2.3 binaries. Investigation shows
 problem is really in both: # of threads is added to
 nhmms, and counted as Z, so E-values end up depending
 on thread #. (IBM 2.2g binaries weren't compiled w/ threads,
 hence the difference seen by IBM.) In hmmpfam.c:worker_thread(), 
 we were bumping nhmm++ before successfully reading the HMM,
 so on normal exit, each thread bumps nhmm one extra time after
 the HMM file is emptied.

 To reproduce:   hmmpfam --cpu 0 <any hmm> <any seq> vs.
                 hmmpfam --cpu <n> <any hmm> <any seq> 
 should give identical E-values.
 Fixed; verified on Intel/Linux.
