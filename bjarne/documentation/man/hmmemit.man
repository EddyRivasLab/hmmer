.SH NAME
hmmemit - sample sequences from a profile HMM

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hmmemit
.I [options]
.I hmmfile


.SH DESCRIPTION

Sample (emit) sequences from the profile HMM in
.I hmmfile,
and output them.
The
.I hmmfile 
should contain only a single HMM, not a library of them; only the
first HMM will be read.

The default is to sample a sequence sequence from the core probability
model.

Sampling sequences may be useful for a variety of purposes, including
creating synthetic true positives for benchmarks or tests.


.SH COMMON OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available
options.

.TP
.B -c
Emit a consensus sequence, instead of sampling a sequence from the
profile HMM's probability distribution. The consensus sequence is
formed by selecting the maximum probability residue at each match
state.

.TP
.BI -o " <f>"
Direct the output sequences to file
.I <f>,
rather than to
.I stdout.

.TP
.B -p
Sample sequences from the implicit profile, not from the core model.
The core model consists only of the homologous states (between the
begin and end states of a HMMER Plan7 model). The profile includes the
nonhomologous N, C, and J states, local/glocal and uni/multihit
algorithm configuration, and the target length model.  Therefore
sequences sampled from a profile may include nonhomologous as well as
homologous sequences, and may contain more than one homologous
sequence segment. By default, the profile is in multihit local mode,
and the target sequence length is configured for L=400. To change
these defaults, see Options Controlling Emission from Profiles, below.

.TP
.BI -N " <n>"
Sample
.I <n>
sequences, rather than just one.



.SH OPTIONS CONTROLLING EMISSION FROM PROFILES

All these options require that the
.I -p
option is also set.


.TP
.BI -L " <n>"
Configure the profile's target sequence length model to generate a
mean length of approximately <n> rather than the default of 400.

.TP
.B --local
Configure the profile for multihit local alignment.

.TP
.B --unilocal
Configure the profile for unihit local alignment (Smith/Waterman).

.TP
.B --glocal
Configure the profile for multihit glocal alignment.

.TP
.B --uniglocal
Configure the profile for unihit glocal alignment.


.SH OTHER OPTIONS

.TP
.BI --seed " <n>"
Seed the random number generator with
.I <n>,
an integer >= 0. 
If 
.I <n> 
is nonzero, any stochastic simulations will be reproducible; the same
command will give the same results.
If 
.I <n>
is 0, the random number generator is seeded arbitrarily, and
stochastic simulations will vary from run to run of the same command.
The default is 0: use an arbitrary seed, so different
.B hmmemit
runs will generate different samples.
