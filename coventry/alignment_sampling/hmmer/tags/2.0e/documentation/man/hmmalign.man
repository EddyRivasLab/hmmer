.SH NAME
.TP 
hmmalign - align sequences to an HMM profile

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hmmalign
.I [options]
.I hmmfile
.I seqfile

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B hmmalign
reads an HMM file from
.I hmmfile
and a set of sequences from 
.I seqfile,
aligns the sequences to the profile HMM, 
and outputs a multiple sequence alignment.

.PP
.I seqfile 
may be in any unaligned or aligned file format
accepted by HMMER. If it is in a multiple alignment format
(e.g. MSF, SELEX, ClustalW), the existing alignment
is ignored.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print brief help; includes version number and summary of
all options, including expert options.

.TP
.B -m
Include in the alignment only those symbols aligned to match states.
Do not show symbols assigned to insert states. 

.TP 
.BI -o " <f>"
Save alignment to file
.I <f>
instead of to standard output.

.TP
.B -q
quiet; suppress all output except the alignment itself.
Useful for piping or redirecting the output.

.TP 
.B -A
Append mode; append to
.I newhmmfile
rather than creating a new file. 

.TP
.B -F
Force overwriting of 
.I newhmmfile.
E.g., if 
.I newhmmfile
already exists, and
.I -A 
is not being used to append to the file,
hmmconvert will refuse to clobber the existing
file unless 
.I -F 
is used.

.TP
.B -P
Convert the HMM to Compugen XSW extended profile format,
which is similar to GCG profile format but has two
extra columns for delete-open and delete-extend costs.
(I do not believe that Compugen publicly supports this
format; it may be undocumented.)
