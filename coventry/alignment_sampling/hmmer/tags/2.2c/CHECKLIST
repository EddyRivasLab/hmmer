Checklist for a distribution.

- Update version number information. Versions appear in:
       top-level Makefile
       src/versions.h

- Set RELCODE in Makefile. This is the tag that will be attached to
  RCS files. Very important to change this before a new release.

- Check that all RCS working files are checked in. Subdirectories:
	src/
	Demos/
	Man/
	Shiva/

future improvements:

- modify man pages so that they can be modified on the fly in an
installation to pick up information like the release, releasedate.
