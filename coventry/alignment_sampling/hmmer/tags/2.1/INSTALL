Brief installation instructions for HMMER 2.1
SRE, Wed Oct  7 10:45:15 1998
------------------------------------------

cd to toplevel directory (where this INSTALL file is), then:
    ./configure            Configures the software for your system.
    make                   Builds the binaries. 
    make check             Runs the test suite.
    make install           Installs the software. (You may need to be root.)

That's it. It should build cleanly on just about any UNIX machine.

For (much) more detail, see the Installation chapter in the HMMER
User's Guide.
