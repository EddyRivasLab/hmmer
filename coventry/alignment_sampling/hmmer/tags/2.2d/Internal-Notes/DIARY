  Forward() in place. 
   timing: on 200 random seqs of length 150, globin model M=151:
     2.0a1 hmms:  14.052u    300K cells/sec  (Forward)
      1.9m hmms:   3.259u   1400K cells/sec
  ILogsum() may be giving something like a 5x speed hit, which is
  bad but not awful. Will know better after a Viterbi implementation.

  Viterbi() in place.	
     2.0a1 hmms:   6.865u    650K cells/sec  (Viterbi) 	
  Getting hit with only a 2x factor by ILogsum(); another 2x by
  other stuff. Profiling shows no obvious offending lines; 2x maybe
  coming from array dereferencing.

  maxmodelmaker prototype in place.
  kinase.ALIGN timing: ~50 sec. (cc -O2). profile with prof -pixie -h
  added build_cij() -1 return code -> 7.811u  
  MAP hmmb's run on all PFAM .ALIGN files.
  no code breaks. appears reasonably close to 1.8.1.

  Shiva/ subdirectory created for "destructive" testing.
  hmmb-all-pfam.pl test written.
  1 code break: wnt.ALIGN : B->E transition, WNT5_DROME/553-704, all N assigned.
  large deviations in min scores prob. caused by fragments in .ALIGN
  insert justification in Traces2Alignment()
