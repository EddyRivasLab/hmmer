o About this software:
   HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for sensitive
   database searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries.

   Basically, you give HMMER a multiple sequence alignment as input,
   and it builds a statistical model called a "profile hidden Markov
   model" which you can then use as a query into a sequence database
   to find (and/or align) additional homologues of the sequence
   family.


o Getting HMMER:

   Distribution:   ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/


o Developer access (password needed):
   Subversion:     https://skynet.wustl.edu:8080/sre/src/hmmer


o Installing HMMER:
   The file INSTALL gives brief instructions.
   In the User Guide (Userguide.pdf), the Installation chapter gives
   more detailed instructions.


o Getting started with HMMER:
   See the Tutorial section of the User's Guide (Userguide.pdf)
   for a quick introduction to how to use HMMER.


o Registering HMMER:
