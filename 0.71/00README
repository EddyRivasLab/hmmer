o About this software:
   HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for sensitive
   database searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries.

   Basically, you give HMMER a multiple sequence alignment as input,
   and it builds a statistical model called a "profile hidden Markov
   model" which you can then use as a query into a sequence database
   to find (and/or align) additional homologues of the sequence
   family.


o Getting HMMER:
