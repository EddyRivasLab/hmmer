Brief installation instructions for HMMER @RELEASE@
SRE, Tue Dec  5 13:09:31 2006
------------------------------------------

These are quick installation instructions for the source code. For
complete documentation, see the Installation chapter in the HMMER
User's Guide (Userguide.pdf). 

The installation is a standard GNU-style install, except for some
special ./configure arguments you probably want to pay attention to.


1. Unpack the tarball.
    % uncompress hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar.gz  
    % tar xf hmmer-@RELEASE@.tar         
    % cd hmmer-@RELEASE@   

2. Configure.
   If you just do ./configure, it'll work, but the default
   configuration will give you unoptimized code and it won't
   include useful optional features like multithreading and
   the ability to deal with large files (>2GB).
   You really want to do something like:

    % env CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" ./configure --enable-threads --enable-lfs

   You can use whatever CC and CFLAGS are appropriate for your
   favorite optimizing compiler. 

   If you're on a PowerPC (Mac or IBM), add --enable-altivec and
   you'll get very fast Altivec code thanks to Erik Lindahl. 
 
   If you have PVM installed, add --enable-pvm and you'll get
   PVM parallelization for running on clusters.


3. Compile, test, and install.
    % make                         
    % make check 
    % make install

  The 'make check' runs a set of exercises. All should pass.

  You might need to be root to do 'make install'. The default install
  goes to /usr/local/bin/
