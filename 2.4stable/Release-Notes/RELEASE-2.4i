HMMER 2.4i release notes

________________________________________________________________

2.4i is an interim version, containing a few feature requests and bug
fixes for aficionados. This is not a production release. The current
production release is still version 2.3.2 (October 2003).


===============
= Expostulation
===============

HMMER is currently being rewritten for a planned 3.0 release.
However, no end to that project is clearly in sight.

In order to be able to release minor feature requests and bug fixes, I
have decided to continue to develop and release the 2.x code,
independent of the major changes going on in HMMER3.

2.4i ("2.4 interim") is the first release from this branch.  This
release should be considered to be development code. Use it if its
added features are useful to you, but be cautious, as this release has
not been tested as extensively as 2.3.2, the current stable HMMER
release.

I chose not to base this release on the 2.3.2 production code because
there were several useful changes in the development code from Oct
2003 to early 2005 that made it easier to incorporate the "fragment
tolerance" feature in hmmbuild. I could not use any dev code from
later than spring 2005, when 3.0 development started and the
development trunk became unusable. Thus, 2.4i consists of a snapshot
of HMMER's development trunk as of January 2005, plus a limited merge
of some later changes. Thus it does contain some experimental and
unfinished code - precisely the code that led me in early 2005 to
decide a complete 3.0 rewrite was necessary. That unfinished code
makes me worry a bit about possible stability issues in 2.4i. I think
I closed all the loose ends, but can't be sure. Please report any
problems you see.



=======================
= New features included
=======================

-:-  hmmbuild now deals with alignments that contain sequence
     fragments. Alignments like this have become common because
     of metagenomic analysis projects.  (Requested by many, including
     Gerard Manning [Salk Institute] and Shibu Yooseph [Venter
     Institute].)

-:-  'hmmindex --av' indexes a Pfam database better, or any database
     that uses <accession>.<version> style accession numbers. The --av
     option tells hmmindex to index both the full accession name
     (that is, <accession>.<version>) and the base accession name
     (that is, <accession>) as retrieval keys. This lets you 
     use hmmfetch to retrieve models by their base Pfam accession, even
     when you don't know the latest version number. (Requested
     by Ewan Birney, Dec 2006.)

-:-  A new implementation of the Altivec optimized code for PowerPC
     chips is included from Erik Lindahl [Stanford]. (It is activated
     by ./configure --enable-altivec, when you install on a Mac or IBM
     PowerPC platform.) This version is about twice as fast as the 
     previous version.



=============================
= New features *not* included
=============================

A number of important features have been contributed to HMMER in the
past three years, including optimizations for several platforms from
Intel, IBM, and others; a general new framework to support many such
optimizations from Jeremy Buhler [WashU]; new parallel implementations
for MPI, OpenMP, and vector Crays; a BLAST-like accelerated algorithm
from Elon Portugaly and Steve Johnson (HMMERHEAD); and an iterative
search version (JACKHMMER) from Steve Johnson. I hate to delay the
release of all these great features, but currently my plan is to
release them all with 3.0 in one big bang. 

However, now that we have an interim 2.4 release branch where this
stuff can go while 3.0 develops, waiting is not the only option. Feel
free to pressure me into incorporating your favorite feature into 2.4
if you like. I'm trying to strike a balance of where I spend my time.
Left to my own devices, I'm trying to invest all my time in getting
3.0 done right now.
