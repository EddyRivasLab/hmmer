Checklist for a HMMER release
SRE, Thu Feb  4 10:56:25 2010
--------------------------------------------------------
When editing this 00CHECKLIST, edit it in the trunk, not in a release
branch; it isn't included in releases anyway.

Subversion repository:  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer

HMMER follows an 'unstable trunk' policy.  Each major release goes
onto a stable branch.  Every release (even minor ones) is tagged.

Release types: major releases, minor releases, and snapshots. A major
release gets its own branch. A minor release puts bug fixes into a
major branch. A snapshot is from the development trunk.

Version naming:                                               example
major             <lineage>.<major-release>                   3.0
minor             <lineage>.<major-release>.<minor-release>   3.0.1
alpha             <lineage>.<major-release>a<n>               3.0a1 
beta              <lineage>.<major-release>b<n>               3.0b3 
release candidate <lineage>.<major-release>rc<n>              3.0rc2 
snapshot          <lineage>.<major-release>.snap<yyyymmdd>    3.0.snap20080325


1. Announce intent to release to all developers. 
   Commit working copies on all machines.
   Check for stray uncommitted files:
	 ./configure
         make distclean
         svn update
	 svn status
   Clean up any stray files identified by 'svn status'.
   'svn add' and 'svn commit' as needed to commit new or modified files.


================================================================
= Creating a new major release branch, if necessary
================================================================

For major public releases (3.0, 3.1): we create a Subversion branch,
so we can continue support (with bugfixes) without disrupting
development of the next main release.

*  First test the development trunk.
   Compile should be entirely clean when compiled -Wall.
   'make check' should be clean.
   'make dev' should be clean.
   '(cd documentation/alphaguide; make)' should work

   When trunk is clean, 
   svn commit
   We're (usually) next going to move out of the trunk to the release branch.

*  Create stable release branch from the trunk.
   All subsequent bugfix releases will happen in this branch, while trunk keeps moving.

   svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk\
            https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0\
            -m "created HMMER 3.0 release branch"          
   svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk\
            https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/hmmer/3.0\
            -m "created HMMER 3.0 release branch"          

================================================================
= Work in the current release branch (~/releases/hmmer-release)
================================================================

Once a release branch has been taken (either new, or by a merge from
the trunk destined to become a release), work only in the release
branch. We'll merge changes back to the trunk when the release cycle
is complete.

* Checking out a release branch for the first time, in ~/releases/
    cd ~/releases
    svn checkout https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0  hmmer-release

Don't call this working directory hmmer-3.0, nor hmmer! Call it
hmmer-release, because later "make dist" is going to try to create
hmmer-xx as its release, and because you want to recognize that it's
different from src/hmmer.

If this is the first time (a new release branch), you also need to
update the "svn:externals" so Easel is checked out from the
appropriate stable branch too.

   svn proplist --verbose https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0
   svn propedit svn:externals hmmer-release
      easel   https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/hmmer/3.0
   cd hmmer-release
   svn update
   svn commit

Note the hassle with svn:externals, because it currently only accepts
absolute URLs. Relative paths are supposed to become available in
Subversion 1.5, which may help. Later if we merge the branch back to
the trunk, the merge will mess up easel's externals, and we'll have to
propedit the trunk.


================================================================
= Large merges from the trunk: try to avoid
================================================================

It's preferable to add bug fixes to the release branch, then merge
them one at a time back to the trunk.

However, there may be times when we merge the trunk to the branch in
toto, as one big diff. To do that, if you must:

first merge hmmer trunk in:
   cd ~/releases
   svn checkout https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0 hmmer-release
   cd hmmer-release
   svn merge https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0   https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk

now fix the svn:externals:
   svn propedit svn:externals hmmer-release
     easel   https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/hmmer/3.0

now merge into easel:
   cd hmmer-release/easel
   svn merge https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/hmmer/3.0 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk


================================================================
= Preparing a distribution
================================================================

We prepare and make a distro; later we test it thoroughly. This way
we'll test exactly the version that's rolling out. If something goes
wrong, it's easy enough to come back and make a new tarball.


* Write the release notes in releases/.
  To gather information, check:
   HMMER bugs/BUGTRAX - update this file to mark release that fixed
                        bugs, and divider indicating release.
   Paper notebook since last release
   svn log since last release:
   svn log -r2837:HEAD https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk
   svn log  -r350:HEAD https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk

   When done, svn add the new RELEASE-xxx file.


* Edit configure.ac: make sure version, date, copyright info is set correctly
   emacs configure.ac
   autoconf; (cd easel; autoconf)
   ./configure
   . release-notes/LICENSE.sh

* Build versions for the Tutorial runs.

This needs to be an icc/MPI version - mpi tests are included. 
Build a previous version (3.0rc1) in addition to the release candidate.

icc 11.1 with IntelMPI; on login-eddy
gcc 4.1.2 without mpi;  on login-eddy

Note that my .bashrc includes some configuration of the compilation
environment. I have functions "setup_icc_intel64" and "setup_icc_ia32"
for setting up the appropriate icc. I also have a number of Intel MPI
environment variables set.

On login-eddy (our compile host):
  ssh login-eddy
  cd releases/hmmer-release
  autoconf
  mkdir build-gcc
  cd build-gcc
  ../configure    2>&1  > build.out
  make            2>&1 >> build.out
  make dev        2>&1 >> build.out
  make check      2>&1 >> build.out

  ssh login-eddy
  cd releases/hmmer-release
  make distclean
  mkdir build-icc-mpi
  cd build-icc-mpi
  setup_icc_intel64
  ../configure CC=icc LDFLAGS=-static-intel --enable-mpi   2>&1 > build.out
  make            2>&1 >> build.out
  make dev        2>&1 >> build.out
  make check      2>&1 >> build.out

  ssh login-eddy
  cd releases/hmmer-3.0rc1
  make distclean
  mkdir build-gcc
  cd build-gcc
  ../configure  2>&1  > build.out
  make          2>&1 >> build.out
  make dev      2>&1 >> build.out
  make check    2>&1 >> build.out

  ssh login-eddy
  cd releases/hmmer-3.0rc1
  mkdir build-icc-mpi
  cd build-icc-mpi
  setup_icc_intel64
  ../configure CC=icc LDFLAGS=-static-intel --enable-mpi 2>&1 > build.out
  make          2>&1 >> build.out
  make dev      2>&1 >> build.out
  make check    2>&1 >> build.out

This sets up:

Release candidate:
  srcdir              ~/releases/hmmer-release
  builddir (gcc)      ~/releases/hmmer-release/build-gcc
  builddir (icc,MPI)  ~/releases/hmmer-release/build-icc-mpi

3.0rc1 (old version for regression):
  srcdir              ~/releases/hmmer-3.0rc1
  builddir (gcc)      ~/releases/hmmer-3.0rc1/build-gcc
  builddir (icc,MPI)  ~/releases/hmmer-3.0rc1/build-icc-mpi


* Update the user guide - including the tutorial section, and
  version numbers in the installation section.
  See last ~/notebook entry for scripts.
  Don't slack off on this step - it's a useful regression test as well.

* Clean up.
    make distclean
    svn status
do any cleanup... 
    svn commit


================================================================
= Creating a source distribution
================================================================

${HMMER_VERSION} tag used below should match @HMMER_VERSION@ in configure.ac, Makefile

* You can put it in the environment and everything will work as cut/paste:
   export HMMER_VERSION=3.0rc2
   cd ~/releases

* Delete any old releases of the same number
   rm -rf hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}
   rm -f  hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}.tar
   rm -f  hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}.tar.gz

* Export a snapshot, alpha, beta, or release candidate from the development trunk: 
   svn export https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/trunk hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}
   cd hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}

  or: Export a major or minor release from its branch
   svn export https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/hmmer/branches/3.0 hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}
   cd hmmer-${HMMER_VERSION}
   autoconf; (cd easel; autoconf)
   ./configure
   . release-notes/LICENSE.sh

  3.0rc2: exported 3224/554
  3.0rc1: exported 3160/510
  3.0b3:  exported 3051/442

* Check that svn has file permissions right
   find . ! -perm -u+r -print
   find . -perm o+x ! -perm -u+x -print

* versioning, dating, licensing (these are originally set in configure.ac)
* must do Easel first
