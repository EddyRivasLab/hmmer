Interim notes for upcoming 3.1 release
so stuff doesn't get forgotten that needs to be noted...


Small changes that nonetheless affect output:
(watch out for, if you are running regression tests)

-:- The "bias" score values in all output formats, for both
    per-sequence and per-domain outputs, were erroneously
    reported in nat units in 3.0, whereas all other scores are
    bit scores. 3.1 now corrects this; the bias values
    are in units of bits.
