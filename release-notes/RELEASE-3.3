HMMER 3.3 release notes     (IN PROGRESS)
Previous release was 3.2.1  (June 2018)

---------------------------------------------------------------


CHANGES AFFECTING OUTPUT RESULTS OR FORMATS:

- hmmstat: the number reported in the output column marked `compKL`
  has changed. See FIXED BUGS section below.


FIXED BUGS:

- hmmstat reports a column called 'compKL', for 'composition KL
  divergence'.  This is a measure of how composition-biased a profile
  is. It is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the average match
  state emission probabilities and the background frequencies.
  Previous HMMER versions were calculating it incorrectly in detail in
  two respects, although the number still served as a useful
  statistic. First, it was calculating a nonstandard symmetric KL
  distance `\frac{KL(P \parallel Q) + KL(Q \parallel P)} {2}`; the
  standard symmetric KL distance does not divide by two. Second,
  because of an error, the value was being reported in base 1.617
  logarithmic units, not bits, because a conversion from nats to bits
  had been applied twice. The `compKL` value is now a standard KL
  divergence (i.e. relative entropy; nonsymmetrized), in bits.
