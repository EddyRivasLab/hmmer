Announcing the release of HMMER 1.8.4.

This is a bugfix release. hmma -m (the option that strips insertions
out of an hmma alignment and shows only `matched' symbols) was badly
broken in more than one interesting way. Thanks to Bill Bruno (Los
Alamos National Laboratory) for reporting the bug(s).

Also, hmma -m now leaves an `x' behind in place of an insertion of one
or more residues.
