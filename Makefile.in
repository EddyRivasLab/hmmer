# Makefile for HMMER: Main project directory: installation, documentation
# SVN $Id$
#
# On most Unices, you can build the package without modifying anything 
#   by just typing "./configure; make".
#
# You may want to modify the following make variables:
#   BINDIR  - where the executables will be installed by a 'make install'
#   MANDIR  - where the man pages will be installed by a 'make install'
#   CC      - which compiler to use
#   CFLAGS  - compiler flags to use
#
# Sort of uses GNU coding standards. ${prefix} might be /usr/local.
# ${exec_prefix} gives you some flexibility for installing architecture
# dependent files (e.g. the programs): an example ${exec_prefix} might be
# /nfs/share/irix64/
#
# You can also provide DESTDIR from the commandline, for installation
# in a buildroot; for example:
#     make DESTDIR=~/rpm/tmp/buildroot install
# By default, DESTDIR is null.
# This was added by request (rousse@ccr.jussieu.fr), to support 
# packaging of an official Mandrake Linux contrib RPM.
