/* Function: WriteProfile()
 * Date:     SRE, Wed Jan 21 07:58:09 1998 [St. Louis]
 *
 * Purpose:  Given an HMM, write a GCG profile .prf file as
 *           output. Based on examination of Michael Gribskov's Fortran
 *           source in GCG 9.1; on reverse engineering
 *           by examination of GCG 9.1 output from "profilemake"
 *           and how the .prf file is used by "profilesearch";
 *           and on the GCG 9.0 documentation.
 *           
 *           See notes 28 Jan 98 for detail; in brief, the conversion goes like:
 *           
 *           PROF(i,k) = match score         =  msc(i,k) + TMM(k-1)
 *           
 *           GAP(k)    = cost per insertion  =  TMI(k-1) + TIM(k-1) - TMM(k-1) - TII(k-1)
 *           LEN(k)    = cost per inserted x =  TII(k-1)
 *           
 *           QGAP(k)   = cost per deletion   =  TDM(k-1) + TMD(unknown) - TMM(k-1) - TDD(k-1)
 *           QLEN(k)   = cost per deleted k  =  TDD(k-1)
 *           
 *           Note that GCG affine gaps are GAP + n * LEN;
 *           HMMER affine gaps count (n-1) * gap-extend, thus an
 *           extra TII gets taken away from GAP (and TDD from QGAP),
 *           since GCG will charge it.
 *           
 *           Also note how the TMM transitions, which have no equivalent
 *           in a profile, get smuggled in OK.
 *           
 *           Also note that GCG charges gaps using the profile position
 *           /after/ the gap, not preceding the gap as HMMER does.
 *           
 *           Also note the TMD(unknown) in the QGAP calculation. HMMER
 *           distinguishes between gap-open and gap-close, but GCG does not,
 *           so there is a fundamental incompatibility here. Here
 *           we use an upper (best-scoring, minimum-cost) bound. 
 *           
 *           And finally note that GCG's implementation forces GAP=QGAP and
 *           LEN=QLEN. Here, we upper bound again. Compugen's implementation
 *           allows an "extended profile" format which distinguishes between
 *           the two. 
 *           
 *           The upper bound approach to these scores means that a 
 *           score given by an emulated profile is an upper bound: the HMMER
 *           score (for a single Smith/Waterman style local alignment)
 *           cannot be better than this. This is intentional, so that
 *           the Compugen BIC can be used for rapid prefiltering of
 *           the database.
 *           
 *           To get a close approximation of hmmsw scores, call
 *           profilesearch as
 *                profilesearch -noave -nonor -gap 10 -len 1
 *           On the Compugen BIC, using extended profiles, you want:
 *                om -model=xsw.model -gapop=10 -gapext=1 -qgapop=10 -qgapext=1 -noave -nonor
 *
 * Args:     fp      - open FILE to write to (or stdout, possibly)
 *           hmm     - the HMM to write   
 *           do_xsw  - TRUE to write Compugen's experimental extended profile format
 *
 * Returns:  (void)
