Brief installation instructions for HMMER 2.1
SRE, Wed Oct  7 10:45:15 1998
------------------------------------------

For a source distribution (hmmer-2.1.tar.Z):

    uncompress hmmer-2.1.tar.Z   Uncompresses the archive.
    tar xf hmmer-2.1.tar         Unpacks the archive. (makes a new directory, hmmer-2.1)
    cd hmmer-2.1                 Moves into the distribution toplevel directory.
    ./configure                  Configures the software for your system.
    make                         Builds the binaries. 
    make check                   Runs the test suite to test the new binaries.
    make install                 Installs the software. (You may need to be root.)

    It should build cleanly on just about any UNIX machine.

For a binary distribution (hmmer-2.1-<platform>-<os>.tar.Z, for example, sun-solaris):

    uncompress hmmer-2.1-sun-solaris.tar.Z
    tar xf hmmer-2.1-sun-solaris.tar
    cd hmmer-2.1
    ./configure
    make install

    Note that "make" and "make check" aren't necessary, since you
    have a precompiled distribution.

    If your machine doesn't have a C compiler, the ./configure will
    fail, and you won't be able to do a "make install". This is
    an artifact of the way I have the configure script built.
    If this happens, just copy the man pages and binaries whereever
    you want them, for instance:

    cp Man/*      /usr/local/man/man1/
    cp binaries/* /usr/local/bin/

For (much) more detail, see the Installation chapter in the HMMER
User's Guide.
