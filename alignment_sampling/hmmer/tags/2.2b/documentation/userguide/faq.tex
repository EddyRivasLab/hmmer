[How do I cite HMMER?]
There is still no single peer-reviewed reference to the HMMER
package. Depending on the standards of your journal, here are
some possibilities.

If the journal will accept WWW references, I recommend:

\begin{quote}
Eddy, S.R. (1998) HMMER: Profile hidden Markov models for
biological sequence analysis. Software freely available from
http://hmmer.wustl.edu
\end{quote}

If the journal doesn't accept WWW references but will allow
unpublished references or personal communications, I recommend:

\begin{quote}
Eddy, S.R. (1998) HMMER: Profile hidden Markov models for
biological sequence analysis. Unpublished.
\end{quote}

And if the journal won't accept unpublished references at all, I
recommend citing one or more of my profile HMM review papers
\cite{Eddy96,Eddy98}.
