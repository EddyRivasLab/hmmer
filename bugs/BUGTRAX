DESCRIPTION     
  hmmbuild crashed on a particular input alignment, with memory
  corruption. Culprit is a sequence that is all insert states, all in
  one insertion internal in the model.  Problem was in
  tracealign.c:map_new_msa(), which only set k at first D or M
  state. Fix was to rewrite (and greatly simplify) the calculation of
  inscount[], using insnum[] array.

DESCRIPTION     
   Moretti reports a number of unit test failures. We asked for a 
   gdb stack trace, which he provided; it shows a failure in 
   esl_dirichlet.c, utest_io, esl_tmpfile_named(). Here we
   are assigning char tmpfile[] = "esltmpXXXXXX". This may be
   insufficient to make the compiler give a modifiable string;
   it should be char tmpfile[16] or some such.

   Replace tmpfile[] with tmpfile[16] in esl_dirichlet.c; this
   is the only place that this error appears to occur. (And thus,
   this bug cannot account for all of Moretti's observed test
   failures.)

DESCRIPTION     
  Rarely, two different (overlapping) envelopes can produce the
  same OA alignment. 

  McAnulla's example is the Pfam_B model Pfam-B_9291 against 
  Uniparc UPI0000022264.

  Implemented workaround_bug_h74() in p7_tophits.c. This hides all but
  one envelope containing a duplicate alignment.

  A better fix is to define envelope by profile endpoints in addition
  to sequence endpoints, revise rescore_isolated_domain() to take
  profile endpoints into account, and write versions of Forward and
  Backward that limit the calculation to an envelope on the profile.
  Defer this to future.

DESCRIPTION     
  Elena reports a bug in p7_hmm_CalculateOccupancy. Mean of the insert geometric 
  is 1/t_IM, not 1/t_II. 

  This affects the calculation of hmm->compo, the model mean
  composition, which is used to construct the two-state HMM used by
  the bias filter. Therefore the bugfix had the potential to alter
  results. Verified that a benchmark (profmark) is essentially
  unchanged -- there is a tiny change, insignificant but unfortunately
  detrimental (by about 1%). 

  This bugfix may change results, because targers can appear/disappear
  due to the alteration in the bias filter.

  Added a unit test, utest_composition(), to verify that compo is
  correctly calculated -- validation against composition of large set
  of sampled emitted seqs.

DESCRIPTION     
   hmmscan --tblout seg faults if it tries to write information for an
   HMM that lacks optional accession or description information.

   The problem is a lack of consistency (and documentation) in how
   P7_HIT handles optional information. hit->acc and hit->desc should
   be NULL. But p7_pipeline.c was just strdup'ing different
   conventions: ESL_SQ (in hmmsearch mode) uses \0 convention,
   P7_OPROFILE (in hmmscan mode) uses NULL convention.
   TabularTargets() and TabularDomains() were checking against the \0
   convention, which meant that they'd access a NULL ptr and segfault
   in hmmscan mode.

DESCRIPTION     
  Fish provides an example of an rpoB HMM and a high-scoring sequence.
  hmmalign silently fails on this sequence because p7_Decoding()
  returns an ERANGE error.

  The ERANGE error is documented in [J3/119-121] and in the
  impl_sse/decoding.c::p7_Decoding() code. Models in unilocal mode may
  have numeric overflow on targets containing more than one
  "domain". Search progams avoid this problem because of careful
  domain postprocessing; it is rare for p7_Decoding() to see a
  multidomain target, except in unusual situations that I believe
  always involve garbage repetitive sequences, and therefore the
  failure can be silently ignored. 

  But in hmmalign, we are in unilocal mode to begin with, and a user
  may provide us with a "multidomain" target. 

  This needs more thought, but for now, the fix is to detect the
  overflow in hmmalign and fail over to slow generic routines.

DESCRIPTION     
   Under circumstances that have not been identified:
   hmmscan ASCII output replaces HMM "<name> <description>\n" with
   "<name>"; the loss of the newline corrupts the output and breaks
   parsers including pfam_scan.pl.

   Jaina reports an example of it occurring on an "older" Opteron
   running SUSE Linux. It does not happen on our Opteron/SUSE system.
   There is no apparent problem in the source. One suspicion is the
   crossplatform binary compatibility of press'ed HMM databases.

   This appears to be a bug on the Opteron/SUSE, with its handling
   of the "%-.*s" precision in fprintf() when the precision is set
   to INT_MAX. OK, maybe that was asking a little much of it. Changed
   the way unlimited line length is handled; now it formats
   unlimited desc lines simply as "%s".

  hmmpress -f destroys the previous index and fails, rather than

  Problem is that p7_hmmfile_Open() sees the press'ed database and
  opens it, because it's supposed to use the binary db if available;
  but unfortunately the db is about to be overwritten.
 
  Fix is to implement p7_hmmfile_OpenNoDB(), which opens only the
  <hmmfile>, even if a press'ed db is available for it.

  Issue is a harmless floating point comparison; gets (sc > vsc)
  when really (sc == vsc). That is, the sampled trace is identical
  to the Viterbi optimal path, but due to floating point roundoff,
  the score of the sampled trace is a teensy bit more than the Viterbi
  score, and this triggers test failure. Fixed by adding some
  slop/tolerance to the test.

DESCRIPTION     
  Ossandon reports a segfault when running hmmscan of Pfam24 on a

  sporadically here, suggesting a memory corruption. valgrind sees
  uninitialized memory problems. 

  Problem traced to failure to initialize * (and ~, and -) odds ratios
  in null2 model.

  Decreed these odds ratios to be 1.0 (i.e. it isn't clear what the
  probabilities should be, but whatever they are, they're the same in
  null1 and null2 models, and we're only operating with odds ratios
  anyway; so the odds ratios are 1.0). 

  Unit tests should have caught this - and would have, if they'd been
  checking with valgrind (null2_utest fails under valgrind). Added
  valgrind tests to test suite. Added i8-nonresidues.pl to regression
  test the handling of * residues.

   Traced to a segfault when using esl_msa_SetSeqDescription()

   to copy a string that might contain a naked '%', from user
   input outside program's control.
   
   Requires changing the {msa,sq} API: _Set* functions changed to
   _Format*; new _Set* functions take a const string, not a
   printf()-style format string and varargs.

DESCRIPTION     
  On some alignments, hmmbuild fails with fatal exception;
  "validation failed" expected k doesn't match trace's k.

  With fragments, an X->Ik transition is possible.
  p7_trace_Validate wasn't expecting it.

DESCRIPTION     
   In alpha2 code, hmmpress fails with:

   Fatal exception (source file p7_hmmfile.c, line 619):
   ftello() failed

   on a large HMM database.

   Initially this did not seem to reproduce, because I was testing
   current dev code, not alpha2 code. Now I've reproduced it not only
   on AMD Opteron (cf-suse; close to Williams' machine) and even on
   the desktop, using alpha2 code. beta1 code does not show the same
   bug. Attributable to the change to autoconf 2.63; autoconf 2.61
   (used by alpha2) had a bug in how it detected ftello().

DESCRIPTION     
  Domain definition could result in nregions>0 and nenvelopes==0 and
  thus no available domain information if the region(s) were handled
  by stochastic traceback clustering; this resulted in passing the
  nregions==0 failsafe in p7_pipeline, uninitialized domain info
  fields in tophits structure, and segfaults and/or valgrind bleating
  when top sequence hit output routines try to access at least one
  best domain.

  Fix is to add a check for nenvelopes==0 in addition to (could be in
  lieu of) nregions==0 failsafe.

DESCRIPTION     
 Domain definition failure; it's finding two copies of exactly the

 Remmert saw this with jackhmmer -A, where the output alignment can't
 be parsed because it has a dup name in it.

 Simpler reproduction:
   phmmer d1bd8a_.seq bug.fa

 Domain hits include:
  3 !   22.2   0.1   6.5e-09   6.5e-09      48     151 ..     191     262 ..     145     266 .. 0.57

 There was a bug in "domain domination" logic in
 p7_domaindef.c::region_trace_ensemble(): ESL_MIN(len(d), len(d2) was
 doing ESL_MIN(len(d), len(d)) and failing to detect many cases of
 dominated domains.

    % hmmscan Pkinase_Tyr bug.fa
  produces no hits with 3.0a2 code, but 3.0a1 code sees a hit, as does
  hmmscan --max or hmmscan --nobias.

  Problem is that esl_hmm_Configure() doesn't set degenerate residue
  scores properly. I introduced this bug in r326, when I allowed a
  NULL fq[] array to default to uniform background
  frequencies. Background frequency of degenerate residues wasn't
  being summed correctly, resulting in scores getting set to garbage.

  Problem exists from Easel r326 to r331. Fixed in r332.

Hey Sean!

I hope you are well. Just FYI, this could be somehow my fault, but at  
the tail of every hmm* program of HMMER3 on MacOSX, x86_64, which I  
recompiled from your source using icc as you suggested (which gave a  
ton of "option -xk not supported" warnings"), I get the little error:

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmsearch fails w/ "realloc of X bytes failed: file core_algorithms.c line

  file and an HMM:
     hmmsearch PF01121.10.fs UPI0000000001_UPI00005B0DDD

  However, this runs fine on whelk01, wildebeest (Power5/Linux), and
  an AIX Power 5 in Warren's lab. Petryszak's machine is an IBM p690
  Regatta (8x Power4, AIX 5.2), hanni1 at HLRN
  (http://www.hlrn.de/doc/basics.html). Tests on hanni1 reproduce
  the failure.

  The problem appears to be that IBM AIX inscrutably limits 32-bit
  applications to one 256 MB data segment of memory by default.  On
  hanni, w/ 8 processors and a RAMLIMIT of 32 MB/proc, this limitation
  is exposed.  This memory limitation needs to be lifted. There are
  three options:

  1. Compile w/ xlc_r -q64 flag, to create a 64-bit executable. 
     ar needs -X64 flag as well, to archive 64-bit object files.
     Manually modify AR command in Makefile.in in hmmer/ and squid/
     subdirs.

  2. Compile w/ xlc_r -bmaxdata:0x80000000 flag, to make a 32-bit
     executable w/ "large memory model".

  3. Don't run that many cpus; use --cpu <n> flag.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmpfam crashes on Pfam_fs w/ "FATAL: you can't init get_wee_midpt

  The problem is that P7WeeViterbi() is called w/ subseq of L=1. The
  init of P7WeeViterbi sets begin,end points initially to STS, STT;
  but when 1==L, assignment of tassign[L] to STT clobbers tassign[1].

  Fixing this properly will require rethinking get_wee_midpt carefully.

  Instead, hack around it. P7WeeViterbi() is only called once, from
  within P7SmallViterbi(). Insert an extra test; if sqlen==1, do not
  call P7WeeViterbi(), instead allocate a tiny L=1 matrix and use 
  P7Viterbi().

  Document P7WeeViterbi(): it can't take L=1.

DESCRIPTION     
  Turned up in SPEC certification process. Alan L. MacKay
  <amackay@us.ibm.com>, of IBM AIX Compilers/Performance group, sends
  an Insure++ report that shows a case where dsq[] was a negative
  number. Kaivalya reports that they "fixed" this by forcing compilers
  to use unsigned chars by default. A confusing discussion ensues;
  MacKay thinks the problem is the use of char dsq[] as an array index,
  whereas I think the code "guarantees" nonnegative dsq[] and that
  there isn't a problem here; I think the crash IBM saw was coming
  from memory corruption due to bug #h25.

  Nonetheless, he has a point: if I'm going to use dsq[] as an array
  index, it would be better coding practice to declare it as 
  unsigned char.

  Changed dsq from char to unsigned char throughout (and some
  instances of sym, symidx). Removed (int) casts whereever dsq[],
  symidx were being used as array indices.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmpfam search with 125,000aa sequence eventually crashes 
  because of lack of RAM, instead of successfully using small
  memory routines.

  Problem is that the code assumed that M,N can't both grow in
  allocating a matrix, but that's not true in hmmpfam; after P7SmallViterbi(),
  we may hand various sized bits of sequence off for subalignment,
  with different sized models.

  Wrote P7ViterbiSpaceOK(); used it instead of P7ViterbiSize() to switch
  between normal and small variants; allow creation routine to grow in M
  and N (padM and padN can both be positive); make initial allocs for 
  hmmpfam matrices to be 300x300, to avoid pathologically asymmetric
  matrices.

DESCRIPTION     
  hmmsearch crashes unpredictably on Swissprot searches (EMBL
  format).

  AMD contributes an Insure++ report showing three problems:
  1. Alphabet[] is not a string but is being passed to strchr();
  2. readEMBL is looking for a \0 in a growing seq, but a growing
     seq has no \0 until ReadSeq() polishes it off;
  3. xmx[] is shown as a dangling/wild ptr in core_algorithms.c 
     and fast_algorithms.c.
  AMD and/or Intel also indicate, via Kaivalya, that the problem
  is in sqio.c: they explicitly nul-terminate after every reallocation
  of the seq, and the problem disappears.
  Fixed problems 1 and 2. Can't find the problem that Insure++ is
  bitching about for 3; worrying. Bug goes away: it was clearly the result
  of problem 2. Bugs in #1 should only appear for databases with
  nonstandard residues.

REPORTED_BY     Robert A. Wilson <robwilso@us.ibm.com>
CLOSED_DATE     SRE, Fri Jun  6 18:56:43 2003
DESCRIPTION     
 Original report cited difference in E-values between 
 IBM 2.2g binaries and 2.3 binaries. Investigation shows
 problem is really in both: # of threads is added to
 nhmms, and counted as Z, so E-values end up depending
 on thread #. (IBM 2.2g binaries weren't compiled w/ threads,
 hence the difference seen by IBM.) In hmmpfam.c:worker_thread(), 
 we were bumping nhmm++ before successfully reading the HMM,
 so on normal exit, each thread bumps nhmm one extra time after
 the HMM file is emptied.

 To reproduce:   hmmpfam --cpu 0 <any hmm> <any seq> vs.
                 hmmpfam --cpu <n> <any hmm> <any seq> 
 should give identical E-values.
 Fixed; verified on Intel/Linux.
