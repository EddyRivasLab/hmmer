------------------------------------------------------------------

HMMER searches biological sequence databases for homologous sequences,
using either single sequences or multiple sequence alignments as
queries. HMMER implements a technology called "profile hidden Markov
models" (profile HMMs). HMMER is the software engine underlying many
protein family domain databases and large-scale annotation pipelines,
including the Pfam and SMART databases.
