.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fIoptions\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.B Hmmc2
is a text client for the hmmpgmd or hmmpgmd_shard daemons.  When run, it opens a connection to a daemon at the specified
IP address and port, and then enters an interactive loop waiting for the user to input commands to be sent to the daemon.
See the User's Guide for the HMMER Daemon for a discussion of hmmpgmd's command format.
