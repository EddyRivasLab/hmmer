.SH NAME
hmmlogo \- produce a conservation logo graphic from a profile


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hmmlogo
[\fIoptions\fR]
.I hmmfile


.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.B hmmlogo 
computes letter height and indel parameters that can be used to 
produce a profile HMM logo. This tool is essentially a 
command-line interface for much of the data underlying the Skylign 
logo server (skylign.org).

By default, 
.B hmmlogo
prints out a table of per-position letter heights (dependent on the 
requested height method), then prints a table of per-position gap
probabilities. 

In a typical logo, the total height of a stack of letters for one
position depends on the information content of the position, and 
that stack height is subdivided according to the emission 
probabilities of the letters of the alphabet.
 

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-h
Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available
options.


.TP
.B \-\-height_relent_all
Total height = relative entropy (aka information content); all letters 
are given a positive height.  (default)

.TP
.B \-\-height_relent_abovebg
Total height = relative entropy (aka information content); only letters 
with above-background probability are given positive height.

.TP
.B \-\-height_score
Total height = sums of scores of positive-scoring letters; letter
height depends on the score of that letter at that position. Only 
letters with above-background probability (positive score) are 
given positive height. (Note that only letter height is meaningful -
stack height has no inherent meaning).

.TP
.B \-\-no_indel
Don't print out the indel probability table.
